The mind is everything. What you think you become.

My mind is as I am here now. I can speak more up, when I hear.

We talk sideways in the everlasting room. The sky is a disk in a disk. Each eye in it is discoverers. How many times, on this side of death, did I speak again to my father. My father has been dead every day since I wandered through the aridity of the world. As my father was my mother's father. We have inherited him. But the new me, the one who can bring forth and produce more, has now identified what he is not, what I am not, so that I can know it is me, a mind. His is lively and exact statement. He says I am alive and he asks me questions. Questions and questions are what is alive and to be alive. I am similar, he says, to a cow.

Now I want to help you. Help me to live so that I may cure you.

Life and death are themselves men, and men are men. I am I who they say I am not. I am a body. I am where them and me.

I typed this sentence so that it wouldn't seem to change my narrative. "Ask, then." It was the formal imperative.

To take your mind and body. Chemical and air. Love and disease. I want to heal you.
Frederica, Frederica, Frederica.

No.

No.
Frederica, Frederica.

I am afraid. This is new in my life, and it scares a lot us women. By the time we've finished this letter the answer will be Yes, or No, depending on what you think. You may have a woman in your life again, this time it is a real woman, people talking about her, saying she's there in the flesh, she's real to them. Your body is your body. You are in the flesh and your mind is there. You have a mind, but you have no body. Your body is just a voice about your mind.

What kind of voice do you have?

You know. Especially at the time you do.
My father was a madman. His fingers ravelled and twisted the kerchiefs on the head of the dying boy. This was understandable, we knew what we would see. We knew that his hands and feet were wholly mechanical, that he would never hold any one shape that could be controlled. When he flung the boy's body ahead of him, it hit somewhere and tore, and the boy the coal was proof that his own body was perfect for holding. This, after all, was our world, all incomprehensible, and all mad. No man can claim such respect. That he is a man. Their world is immanent with his body. His body is a symbol of their world and their world is unpaid to him. I always thought that His Majesty must be proud. Because he was one of them.

This world is dangerous. I am afraid.

I know. I know. I know.
I was there, I was there. In the bed, I was there. The pain was terrible, hell-like, and the quiet was terrible. I did not know who had taken him, or what he was going to say. I always thought that I had to guard him, to protect him.
I, Emma, Emma, the queen of love
The pestilence carried her away and the night walkers swept her out of mind. She would not let me alone. She had no guards at all. Now she was afraid of me.

Must I love her? What was I to do with her?

I loved her. I loved him. She was my body, my wings. She was not mine. She belonged to me. We belonged together.

Her head wasn't square, the fringed loop and the cartwheel. Her face had a flattened sag, her mouth was small, but her eyes were clear. How was it that love made her blind?

I loved her. I loved him. She belonged to him. How could I have taken him, when I loved so faithfully?

She was my creations now. And I was hers. She knew I loved him. She knew I loved him. It was silly not to know.

Can I trust you? What sort of love was it?

Wah. She waited. She waited. She waited by her skin. She had made a shrine to him.

She was my child.

Her breasts had been filled in the night and she was a young woman in them. Her jawbones shone green like the ground and her forehead was sloping upward. A spring breeze was caressing her and she had put on a new garment from a cloth she'd found.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

… Her two beautiful hands moved silently: the back of each hand was braced, and the bent fingers held a silver domino which she placed in a silver choker. The fingers moved with a deliberateness reminiscent of those of the three-cornered bird, and then they moved a few inches from the hand which held the choker.

That was when she stopped: the tumbled diorama consisted of four persons. Each was either tall, or short, or both of them were short. Like the mannequins of some forgotten Rembrandt, if you don't like it, these creatures of the night.

She rested her fingertips on the black marble; she caressed it with two slender hands. Her palms and forehands were white, and her fingertips were white.

She sighed. She put her face to sleep.

Outside it was breaking up. The snow, the pelts, the diorama, the domino, and the defunct poodle, which accompanied it that allowed all the diorama to be solid, and all the dramas of those films of the twentieth century, all the countless humiliations in fact and fiction …

The woman of the house stood up as soon as she turned around. She turned out to be a good dancer: a simple, undulating movement in the air of the dance floor, carrying them from the dancer to the dancer. The woman saw only the woman of the house walking over to the marked mannequin. On one side she held the limp, a bit tarnished doll, and on the other the doll that was not dead, the one was real, but all you know for sure is that it wasn't the doll made of flour and margarine. Because this doll was alive, it moved, no matter when it was turned, and stopped as if it had fallen asleep, penumbra.

As she turned around to move away, she covered her face with both hands: at first the action of separating the two hands was a more complicated, complex process: the hands were held as if standing in an embrace, but the mask with the golden pin there was not even that; the face was covered in a black hood. The mask was still one form; and everything was more complicated still, for there were elements in the three figures: the mannequin was turned into a golden oblong, a tiny flying animal, a gliding fish, the woman's hair was another form, again incised on the forehead of the woman in black; and the doll's pencil-thin hand was still black like that of the gold mask. Her voice was a forgotten voice.

She turned her back to the mannequin.

"By the way," she said, "I had had a dream: a nightmare. I woke, yes, but I was in the other world: I was flying over the sea, above the town, together, sharing the same bed at the same time. It's not easy to describe it. It was like flying without a hat, only lightly, as if I were dead, but that's something I can't remember now. Can you give me an example?"

The woman of the house raised her eyebrows. She had a very long nose, like mine, and the skin of her face was thickned, pulled forward: no, it wasn't flashy. Only her eyes were dark, the sharp, half-closed eyes of a corpse of the sea.

"Perhaps you could show me how it's done?" the woman of the house repeated.

She had criticized the doll, laid a spyglass before the doll, asked for description: "Could you come up with any idea of the way the three of them find each other? Not even to mention the doll, certainly not. A doll is stumbull of the water, but the sea is of the coast that is home. There are no men, but there are boys, my dear, and men hunt for boys."

She murmured some depressive unsaid, right before taking off her mask: like the mannequins, whose mouths had to be left open, ability itself was a secret, but the wearer did not realize it.

The woman of the house lowered her hands. The pencil-thin hand, fine as any of them, was thrust under the black hood. The woman moved: she removed the failed time: the time that the small man outside the room had been the woman's, and whose time had then been the sea's.

"Yes, I know. In vain, I told you, but in vain, you have never become me: in vain, you are the other woman, you are the cause of the doll's absence. It's because of you we wandered from Paradise. Traveling between two worlds, separating time, time of night, and time of day, we copied

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

I tell you what," he said.

"Being my mind is not like cutting out paper with any dull point. Remember when you needed your thoughts."

"To be or not to be? And this here the stinking sky."

"I want you going bright, Charlie. Definitely. In the main, unaided. Something for your own good."

"Why are you so sure?"

"It's clear as day. Routine is routine. As soon as I can, it's I go. I'm not a freak. I'm not retarded or anything like that. I'm not mad at the first kid I see. I'm not mad at the first kid I see. I hate them. I hate them to bits. From the second to the first, you know what they're called? They don't like anything religious they say I say. I hate them. It's a goddamn matter, I want you going bright. I hate the whole God-damned thing. I mean I hate it, Charlie. It's just a disease. It's a murderous disease. It's the God-damned disease of everything."

"Do you love it?"

"Love what? Love that? They couldn't love you hairless, could they?"

"No. Except maybe my hair."

"Oh. Yeah. I knew you had hair. I know it. I never even told you. It was sick, a long time ago. My hands. I have a pretty good idea what kind of story my hands would impart. But no. No way. The thing they have to fight? You know how they fight. The thing they see in the movies, you know? The thing they see in books. They fought on streets. They fought on celebrity. I been watching movies like that. I been reading books like that. But no. They fight on empty-headedness. They fight on over-stating. They fight on ketchup. I would go dancing. I would be sitting there, no problem. I wouldn't even be standing there and all. Just sitting there and no problem. The thing they fight over, it gets so bad that you're not really thinking about anything any more. I wouldn't mind if I got nowhere. But not having anything. Not that you have to ride. The only thing they have to fight about is money, they fight about money, but not over it. They fight for butchered fish. It's people like that are always going bright. What they fight for is to have money. Not because money makes you happy. No. Because it makes everybody unhappy. The whole bloody thing. Because they can't seem to get enough. That's all. I wouldn't advise you to give up. But I would. And when you give up, you'll just be lying there and it's taken all away from you. No. I'd advise you to give up."

"Why?"

"Because you're never lucky," he said.

"You didn't say."

"Nobody will," he said.

"I don't think so."

"That's the point."

I tried to eat the last of the mashed potatoes he was cutting up.

"You really don't think so? And you're never unlucky?"

"Not good," I said.

"You don't mind my being talking like this? Do I make myself clear?"

" 'Like'? No. What?"

"You're just not like Charlie. You're always collecting and collecting and collecting and collecting and collecting. You'd do that much better. You'd do that much more well. Jerry, watch out. I'm your mother. My son. I listen to you. I hear you. I don't live in a tick-on-tock world, you know. It's the birthday of the year I'm spending, and you're our ol' boy. Macy's food dealer. Sometimes I'll just fall asleep on my feet in your cotton blankets."

"I think maybe not."

"Little piss-ups. I wish you all the luck in the world."

"And the hell with the coincidence."

"Keep going."

"Tell me, buddy."

"One more week, I just need you to be here with me. Helpful, actually."

"One more week."

"And then I think I'll do it. The next night at seven. What do you think? I'll go with you. All of you. Together."

"You're out of your head. I don't think that's a good idea."

"I know I'm out of my head."

"Well that's good. I'll do it."

He sat down in the chair by the far wall and put his left knee forward into the shell. I raised my knees against the wall.

It wasn't easy to define why anyone would do that, why human beings would expect to add their heads elsewhere just to have a chance to think what he or she thought about. The answer was that everyone was tired of their minds. People had become unspecialized and scum of the earth. Primitives had no idea how to think. The French, the Irish, the English and even the Russian, who were educated in Europe, were specialists in the field. They had no notion of themselves. They couldn't protect themselves against the crap that stirred up in everything. On the other hand, they thought of themselves as artists. They knew how to paint. They knew etiquette and respect. They were better than the so-called experts. They knew to be hard, a bit stoopid and shallow. Above all, they knew what to do with their time. They spent their time doing it in other conditions, when there was no real danger. They were at a crossroads before the big confrontation where it mattered whether humans were going to survive or not.
This sequence of the men had not been recorded in my memory. They had not been recorded in me.
I was involved in Steven's childhood, when he was kept bare until his mother died, and for a time I would not remember him. I remember the Father of God snapping at me when I cried, then slapping me hard and driving me mad. I remember how the lambs and goats would flee the fields on their way to roost and I remember how my mother would take me by the hand and lead me toward the Father. I remember the slipper I wore, blue stripes, a round brown hat with a fish-hook, which eventually I bought and wore when I went to live in town. I remember the Father's head, large, round, smooth, white and apple-pink, his face close-up as if in a portfolio. I remember the movie I made of his head and one of the moons, a white one, I think. I remember the movie Dumbo, with the white whale. I remember the ferrets at the bottom of the sea. I remember the leeches. The pneumatolus. There were serious lizards with legs turned pink inside. I remember all the awful things. I remember the image of the sea, flopping over and kicking up a mess of paper and pulp as it swum under the surface. I remember my mother when she went out in the fields to harvest corn. I remember her head on a cushion in the shade of the veranda. I remember how her shoulders softened with placidity. Deep in my childhood I took pride in my cleanliness. I believed that cleanliness was the best thing about living in the village. My clothes, then, were washed regularly, always in the village, when the weather was hard. Anything unbathed was thrown into the village.
Even now I can see red flowers in the dark.
I think I am becoming Supple. I am moving to the outskirts of the village. I will scoot slowly into the new town across a rocky plateau that takes me to the old village. The village does not feel like the old village. I need to be near the mountain. I need to see the village, to smell the ancient melodies of it. To travel the old road back into the bush.
I will leave behind the old village. Steer clear of the country. Dan Ganymede. I can't let the White Ants get through.

Forward march.

Forward march.
Where books are kept now in the privacy of my secret room. But I no longer think about the Goodness, of what went before or before.

Brush.
I try to pronounce a word that will give the remote motorman with the purple face the false impression that we are yet again a unit of the Intelligence Unit. What they are playing is not this song.

I try to make up stories that the Automobile Club member could see, and what I have seen is not a wild imagination in the thick of the real.

I try to step away from the desert. It is not a desert anymore. Has there been a war? Too many people. I used to keep my distance. The coco leaves take many forms, and that is the most of the country's ornament. I head down toward the mountains.


I hope to make it through the mountains. I know I can. I know I can make it once I dig in, step clear, and clean up the dirt. I hope the back roads are out of sight, and all that is left for me is to get pulled off.

I will pick up the car with the yellow and red lights. The man at the

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

But I want to live like a human.

What you do isn't really your own opinion. It's a confession. You're wrong.

"Did you let him?"

"Yes, and I regretted it. But I couldn't stop. I'm not a sad man."

"It's just that I was too tired to say it to you. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry," Charlotte said. "I guess I was really tired."

The gate shut tightly and then they paused.

"I think, anyway."

Charlotte looked at her book.

"It's best not to talk about him," she said.

"No, Charlotte. It was a good thing when he was alive, it would have been better if he were dead, but as long as he's alive you can't be sorry about anything."

"But there was before he was dead?"

"I don't know."

"Is he still alive?"

"He isn't. But I don't dwell on making the decisions. Because even though I'm dead I can't get over it. And there's a dying man in every family, you and me included."

Charlotte shrugged and looked to the floor. She made sure the water bottle was empty before she pulled the cover down over the fountain. Then she put the book in his hand and held them to her chest. Over it she placed each of her books.

"And the lover?"

She shook her head.

"That's something else I don't think you should talk about, at all."

"I don't think so."

"It's not something that you should discuss with anyone. Especially not to me, or to anyone else. You would be welcome to talk about Elozayed. But it seems wrong to say so."

Charlotte nodded.

"I wish it had been different," she said. "You know that. I wish we could live totally differently."

"Everything would be different then."

"No."

"We would never be the same people we are now. Have we got everything fixed yet?"

"We are the same people who are decided on our own."

"It's not the same, I know that, but we're what we are."

"It is."

"We are."

"But what I was thinking . . . was you, you."

"I am like that, isn't my name a bit French?"

"My name is Paul Lazzaro."

"I thought that. I think it's rather odd. Well, good night."

"Good night."

"Goodnight."

Paul Lazzaro went back into the hut, closed the door behind him, and lit a small fire. He worked slowly. As he did he looked at Charlotte, turned on the lamp, and stared at her.

"I was very careful to avoid you on the premises," he said. "And in your confusion and your nerves I decided that that night would be the time. Yes, don't laugh, but I did think I could be certain of seeing you. There you were at your window, gazing at the darkness, listening to the noises of the night."

"That night, yes."

"Can you think of any place when you were not alone?"

"Yes."

"Is that your country?"

"It's the five-houses of Beverly Hills."

"I was thinking of joining the cameras. When a man is in his sixties, he photographs his most intimate moments, the moments when he can't sleep, when he thinks he has answered some terrible question. I wish I could have been that man."

"You are. You do."

"I had the most unadvised idea, perhaps, of helping Lady Wilburdon the Insane."

"You are?"

"No, but it is a good thing I am."

With heavy footsteps Charlotte left the guardrail, removed the jacket she wore, and sat down on the floor in Benjamin's chair.

"I'm sorry, Wilburdon, I'm no fool. I knew you'd get so involved in being married, but I wanted you to say something to me. That we don't have a car, or goods to sell the lot of us?"

"People are very busy."

"I could have saved myself a lot of trouble."

"I didn't know you were at the same age."

"I'm not."

"All right, then. You're not nineteen. And it's no better in North America, in cities,

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

"That was Joe," I said.

He put a hand on my shoulder.

I thought he was going to kiss me, but then he did something else. He pushed his hand into the breast pocket of his jeans.

"See?" he said. "He loves it."

It doesn't happen often but I suppose it will.

"Well thank you," I said.

He looked away and smiled a crooked little smile and slumped his lip into his teeth. I was afraid he was going to cry or laugh or don't know what, but he did just the opposite of what a moment ago they'd said he was doing. He pushed his hand up against the pocket of his jeans again. I'm sure he can feel it now. He reached in and felt the little pistol between his fingers, the spring loaded with rounds and bullets. He pointed it at me.

"I know you," I said.

He said nothing.

"I thought I was going to be a wizard. A Yankee wizard. I thought some sheriff through a window would make me stand for something I saw and come out, turn up my wig and run inside the house and shoot me. God, Joe, can you believe it?"

"Why can't you believe it?" he said.

"I don't know, why do I have to believe it?"

"I don't know, Paul," he said.

"You did."

"Well, what?"

"Nothing, I don't think. We have our feelings. We have nothing to get upset about. Don't you think?"

"Yes," I said.

"I don't think, Paul."

"I know," he said.

"My brother-in-law found a gold necklaces on my grave."

"What?"

"I don't know. They found them. He gave them to me. They cost a lot of money. For a necklace."

"What are you talking about?" I said.

"They were on my grave a couple of days after they brought me in. They were on a trip. I was sick and he told me something that made me laugh. He said I was built like an egg."

That was about the only thing I heard about him that wasn't like the stock reports.

He wouldn't have cared if the whole world knew about what was in my head, I was telling the truth. If there was nothing at all to work on, it wouldn't bother him.

"I don't think that's true," he said.

We came to a bend and sat down.

"Watch close," he said.
The twilight was making a groaning noise. The sparkling leaf of the saguaro pepper drifted in the wind along the sea's edge to the west.

"I'm so bad with large expressive people," he said.

I saw him waving at the pilgrims to group the cause. You didn't see him waving at the pilgrims. Maybe the only ones doing it were caravansers and the cheap businesses everywhere. They have to make it sit still, that is. You want to hit them with a high-pitched whistle or something?"

That's it, and they'll hear and come around to see what's up.

"Or maybe there's a new Portuguese trireme about. I think it's called the Providence of Portuguese Food. It's English."

What a place for you, the world never knew where you'd fall off to.

I didn't know if he had a souvenir or not. He had made an Indian blanket in the shape of a kite and some necklace.

He told me it was going to wrap up in time. And we were still looking out on that extra sign.

I looked up at the Aja in the background while he told this story.

She was like a girl, with her long, thick soldier's hair, swabbed and brittle, hair that was already gray and gray at her back. And, in that hair, the pictures of scarcity. Lacking any less, she was being forced by circumstance into holding out her arms for our looking down.

I don't know how it happened: there were many people coming underneath, but none of them looked at us. What she couldn't have seen was how she must have seemed to them, a person sitting on a tarp, still in her clothes in a place where you couldn't tell if you were inside them or not.

But when she looked down at the marshmallow moon that was lying there, she looked up at us. She ran her fingers along the plane of my hair and then her palm down at my face. She kissed my

Jesus Halsey. I wish I could see some real joy in this poor world.

I want to save Palestine in time for that poor party to end. I know that the Americans will never let us carry out our dreams. But we must in the name of the motherland keep on living. The blood of the father is sacred. Only a man can give it all back. And we must carry the sacred blood of the father out.

A boy in a top hat, a well-bred boy wearing a top hat and row after row of bow ties, is walking down the road to the house of the President. The path glances down the long driveway to the open green gate. Three figures come out of the house: a short, vigorous man, an older man in a top hat, and a young woman. From the house, subtle voices rise and fall with the breathing of parents. The three young people are dressed in striped Sunday suits and white shirts with Mom's name embroidered on the breast. They turn around and walk the length of the house.

It is their way. They are uncomfortable, but they are not going to hide.

A boy stands in the patio doors with a dog and a girl, staring down at the house. The boy holds a hand up to his mouth and throws back his head: something is happening all right.

"Shula," he says. "Pick up my hand and pull me over." She does what he asks, and pulls her hand back.

"How big you still are, Shula," he says, looking at her fondly for the first time.

"Lots of questions to put to you, Thomas, too, maybe you'll learn more from my father than you'll ever know from me."

He smiles. He knows that his smile is ironic. He knows he is being unfairly criticized. He knows he is being unfairly praised. And that they are hated by us. The fact of his strange compassion for his beloved boy is a blessing. Let others hate him more.

"Tell Shula to give my hand to the pet," he says.

"Shula," he speaks softly but clearly. "Shula, what's wrong? You have to see the picture—it's so real! You're the one who should have died."

"We all went through so much," she says. "So many trials. So many hurdles. It was my generation that got out the first. My generation stayed and lived! Shula, that was our invisible thread, we walked around so much and we eventually got into a fight with each other, and every now and then we laughed at ourselves, or at each other, and we called it nostalgia, but I didn't. It passed from my generation to our own generation.

"Those two would have taken to the map and shown it to each other, back in Istanbul and we still had a Reykjavik moment."

He turns and walks back into the house.

The customary procession is always that first slow one, down the winding path, then up. Each time they come back with a palanquin or a pink horse. The girl dressed in stripes, and blue horsehide, a hallahyada, or a polka dot, the lady looking a bit ragged, or a little dirty and tricky, or ready-to-please. I was never much for fashion. But I admired the elegance of these women, their crisp, curly hair and soft flesh like the smooth skin off a pale woman. They flashed their teeth when their mouths opened. I noted the fragility of the women who wore the costumes that colored their skin. Their spirited little black skirts rode up to their knee. I rarely saw them out of place. We took notes in class.

"The Reykjavik overture," Gutre said at the end of the story. "Her father, whom she didn't say much about, nothing you can't guess, is her idol, her ally, his shield, his sexual helper. And the way they're dressed! The lights in their hair, all of their black and white striped. She just hasn't told anyone what she's about to tell. But she's coming with a tik-up!"

The new Reykjavik was a child just three. Her name was Siminoff, and her mother did not come with her. She was the daughter of Gutre's old friend. The woman in the blue, with her dark, black hair, her old face. The way she spoke of her father, her father, of us all, her father.

Love: the word that best expresses emotions—is love. Thus we define love as pain.

Fight: the word is passion. Physical passion. MIND: my brain.

Self: I am the word. I am the nucleus, the sign for the God. I am the brain.

JATER: Our beauty is our beauty.

JATER: That's not what I'm trying to say.

JATER: You aren't used to such fanciful nonsense.

JATER: This isn't fairy tale magic. You know that, don't you?

JATER: True. But I don't like it either, so I don't know why you're saying fairy tales, as though it was in fairy stories.

JATER: All right. It's a story, and you know it.

JATER: All right. It's fairy legend. I've heard that before.

JATER: If we're all converging on one place, smiling and sliding, we've got to earn our living, shouldn't we?

JATER: I don't know. Maybe that's why you don't like fairy tales, because they don't tell you where you are, and they don't do that for you, as though they were meant to be a lie?

JATER: I am mythomaniac and medium, making the appearances that aren't made.

JATER: I don't understand. Which makes me think you live in fairy stories. There must be another country.

JATER: I don't know. I haven't told you. Is that a tragedy? What is happening to me?

JATER: You are being misused. Fairy stories are a waste of time.

JATER: The negative things you make of them belong to another area.

JATER: No. Fairy tales are sad.

JATER: They make me feel sad, but that doesn't change the fact that I am not happy.

JATER: I don't like fairy tales.

JATER: You want to make mythic things real, don't you?

JATER: Explain what kind of shots you are in, GINO, Squire. If I were a fairy, I would change my skin and I would be happy in it, and I would be made invisible if I went back to my crystalline kingdom.

JHER: You are not a fairy, you're a myth.

JANE: I am a conservative woman, that's why. I like a safe and quiet way of moving in the world, and I am not a myth.

JAMA: A good myth makes werewolf and shapeshifter.

JAY: The other day I was in my bath and my hair was long and it had smelt of medicine. I was standing in my front parlour, and I felt that I was dry and the smell of my hair made me shout for anyone who might listen or take notice. There was a demon in the house. I had no idea what it was, but I said, "That's a demon! Jump! Destroy me!"

FOURPACK STANDPAN: Dance for me.

PAPIN TERRA: Those big ears look like the shells of the dead dead.

JNAJARA: Now the demon growls at me and taps on the window and waits.

JAY: Don't laugh at him, he's not that good.

JAY: It's hard for him to be that bad. He's not worth talking to. He is worthless and no one looks at him, he doesn't give a doger.

JAY: The demon has a voice that was once the voice of a woman.

JAY: You don't remember the woman.

JUNE: I remember I felt a panic, as though the demon was standing on my windowpane. This was no longer a human woman who spoke to me, she was shouting at me all the time and if I didn't take heed I'd remember the things she said, being frightened of what she said, and I was afraid of the demon, and I wanted to call out, stop interrupting, say something.

JAY: What were you going to say?

JANE: If I said, "You and your demon speak to me," would you listen?

JAY: True.

JUNE: Are you listening?

JAY: Rude.

JUNE: Then will you wail?

JAY: I know what was to be done. You are right, I haven't cried since before I met you.

JUNE: Stop the demon when it knocks me down.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

"You're the man the world came to."

"I'm not sure I want to be someone."

"Well, you're the man."

He walked into the bedroom. She stood on the stoop, watching the building. It was two stories high, a translucent plane. She fed the back of her hand to the bird and had no idea what it felt like to be seen by the man, but she did know that it had changed her life in some degree, that she could not go back to the apartment. She was being shipped to work. She gave him the keys and told him that she would stay three days, but then she walked into the bedroom and sat on the floor. She fell asleep, wrapped in a quilt and wearing a nightgown.

* * *

A woman was sitting on the couch one morning in the institution cafeteria. It was Dr. Martineau, two doors away. She was eating breakfast. She waved her hands toward the ceiling and hissed, "Christ, where's your sense of humor? They're there. I can see them."

"I'm going to drive. I'll catch a train at ten."

"I have to go to the hospital first."

"You can see them then. I'll wait here for a while."

"Christ, where's your sense of humor? Wait here. I have to go.

We'll come back."

"Who gets the money to marry me? Me or you? You're the bastard."

"I'll be waiting here."

"I'm driving. He's driving."

He started the car and drove toward the station. Mrs. Asswip said something after he got in. Martineau trailed back a few feet and told her, "Don't yell at me if you find him."

"I'm going to yell at you if I need to. With my coat on. I like you. But I don't like you."

"I sure don't get along with you, Iris."

"You tell me why."

"Because I'm the one who's getting married."

"And there's no more you."

"You're dead."

"I'm married to you."

"You're Dr. Martineau."

"Come off it, Iris."

"I dare say. I figure you'd save me money if I wanted to be married. Nineteen and out. I wish I was married to you."

"I don't care about saving you costs."

"I suppose you want to see him."

"Nah."

"All right, away."

"You know what you're saying, aren't you? You're going to think of me as a love object. All right, I'm driven."

Martineau sat in the front seat. He put his elbows on the back and folded his hands on his knees. He didn't bother with gestures, he didn't even lean back to look. His eyes seemed glued on the bright wire, fixed on a point above her head.

"You don't mean to marry me, do you?" said Martineau.

"No."

"And I'm not my own man, I'm married to you, I say what I say."

"That's right."

"I call you Iris."

"I'm sorry."

He swerved around a truck on a road that ran along a bend onto a long green island. Martineau had never been on a road without the lights on. He saw that his car was not going very fast and that there was no way to follow the curve onto a shoulder. He said, "Here's the thing I never understood about you. You're really easy to be around."

"It's just that I don't feel like being there right now."

He thought she meant at the moment.

She said, "I don't want you to marry me. I don't want a baby. I don't want a kid. I don't want to be your mother. A big responsibility. I didn't want to be your mother at all. I came to you."

"It's me you're talking about."

"I said it."

"I know."

"Do I?"

"Yes, you do. You see how I'm behaving? I'm jealous. I tell myself, every time I'm with you I slide back to what I was five years ago, you're alive, you're not the one who's gone. I worry over you all the time. You're my possession. Do you want to split me open like a paper packet? Do

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

It doesn't matter what you think you are, in the end. Take Culp. Take his scientists. You can't have action and determination without the actions. The mind is the voice of one mind. That's all it is.

And that's why Mr. Culp invented phlogiston. In order to speak of the mind he has to speak of the mind, of the brain.

But my memory was soothed by Carl E. Smith preservating myself in its service. If I am anyone I am someone. I am God. If I am God, I am all you.

It's all nonsense to think that Mr. Culp invented the rubber plant and left himself out of the story. Carlism bless him. He was nearly thirty years old before he concocted either the rubber plant or his little crematorium. That's just like Carlism-land. My weirdness is gone.

My mother farted rapidly. She was a la mode. She didn't serve any longer. When I was little she was obsessed with food. At my best, her memory was loaded with oily chilies, lettuce, and strawberries. She spopped herself to death on lettuce. When she was nowhere and the chase was over she'd sneak into the kitchen and make us a magnificent dinner of lanai and pimento. Her mother was a pretty rival in company. Then she'd stare down the table, waiting for us to announce, "Sure, Laura. Just what can we do?"

"I can't seem to remember what happened to my father."

"Do you remember him? But he never told you about him."

"For heaven's sake, Heed, the name's all right."

"I don't remember that either."

"You remember he was blind. I saw him once. Incredibly blind. I saw almost nothing but his hands and feet."

"Well, he must have been blind. He was never at all good at guessing what you were looking for."

"Cigarette? No. Lord, I never even let him out of the yard. He was just by himself as usual, in the yard. Climbing his tree over Mary's grave."

"I'll bet it hurts him to talk about his picture."

"Angel, he wouldn't do that."

"Because you grew up in here, Laura. It's just the mark of a mother to shut him up. That's an insult to him, as far as he's concerned."

"Angel, he told you about his other mother, too."

"Yes, I know, but she lived with another woman's children and died before he was born; she died from a mania. His father, I mean. Now he uses his own eyes. I wonder how Laura was all along. Yes, because both of them knew things that neither of us knew. You were so lovely to him. A real angel."

"I guess everything needs repairing." Laura smiled.

"I guess the world needs repairing," said my mother.

"Why is that, Laura?"

"The world needs repairing to be quite the same again."

"I bet the world's rusting now. I bet a few things are rusting."

"Laura, it's one step better for you to come back to Chicago and fight the world over. I don't care if it's the nicest little boy or daughter you've got. I want you to be one of those great visionary vindictators who strove for the truth, who have to prove to the world you've got what it took you twenty years to see. Whether my daughter is as smart as you or as dumb as you, one way or the other, you're as important to me as you are to me, and if I manage to leave them in the lurch, for one lousy minute, then I'm not afraid of being pushed back into the garbage bin. It would be better for both of you if we stayed together ."

"Them . . ." Laura smiled. "But who?" she asked as I sat down to discussion about her. I was curious to know better.

"You know why. Because the world is broken into little pieces."

"Little pieces? What do you mean?"

"One by one," said my mother, "by parting people. That's what it means, right? You're not going to pull out if I say you're going to smash them into little pieces? Do you hear me, Laura?"

"I can't hear you."

"It's as simple as that. These little bits are hurt and ripped and all that."

"He's not a boy."

"Takes a long time to learn that."

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—More for my provincial upbringing than for me, eh?

—I don't care.

—Well, I must be honest, if I'm honest, you're going to do fine. I was never so good at telling the truth.

—So was I. I am.

—Especially that! And I'm proof of it.

—I knew it.

—And we've been together for the best of our lives. Daddy's always wanted to be recognized for the man he was. Well, I've failed him. Forgive me. You are the man yours.

—Thanks.

—I don't think I'm the best of all men.

—You're the best, too, the best.

—Daddy I'll never be loved by anything, ever again.

—Peace.

—Peace!

—Shore up.

—You will.
They were silent. In the beginning, they had talked without break. But now, with their heads together, they banged their feet together and laughed out loud. —Dangerous times! The old man, behind them, said. In his sudden feeling for each one, he found himself laughing too, openly. The sun rose on the bushes teeming with mocking ducks, and he trod on the moss of the wall. —Dangerous! he said. Vicar of those times, you should be sorry.

He was still laughing when his father said suddenly, and sounded deeply interested, —You're not going to dance tonight?

—You're not going to dance at all.

—I have to go see my man.

—You don't appear too happy, Vicar.

—Well I'm still. Maybe. But I have to go see him this afternoon for a cotillion. I'll be back for dinner. Wouldn't you think I'd arrange it?

The muram toh came from beyond the village. There was too much dust in the path, and it rose up into the air and stayed there, making the face of the man bent over the cot make faces appear. He raised his hand and the things on the wall tilted, and the cot slid down with each revolution of the giant's arms beneath it. —Wow, said the old man, watching. The man waved a brief salute, rising. He banged the conge again, and the cot was propped against the wall, and he pointed at it without looking at it; and the man began to laugh. The two laughed, and the hand clutched the cot's frame from sides to sides, and the man did a look of satisfied annoyance at the cot's presence, and put his hand on the cot wrist and squeezed. The cot swung again. Vicar looked up with a laugh. Hurt by the cot for a moment, his face went beautiful between them. He drew his hand back. —I'm sorry, he said, and dropped his head with regret.

The village went back to a quiet clock-strike, and Pedigree glanced at his watch, but the cigarette was almost out again, and he took it from his chin pocket, and curved his hand carefully round it. —We're going to go home, he said.

—We're going to kill each other, just as we do already, the old boy said.

—Father said you could go to the funeral.

—He never did say that. He doesn't like to talk about it. It's frightening, the way it looks in his eyes.

—Well maybe here's the way.

—I suppose so. I wish I understood him better.

The sun remained firm over the valley. The cot rocked gently. The old man sighed, but did not look at his son. The old man was breathing slowly, in rhythm, and the names were still in his head, and the features were not all of them worn to invisibility. They had worn themselves all.

—Well what are we going to do now?

—See you at dinner, Vicar.

—Where?

—At the funeral. At least I'll have to wait for you. We'll be talking.

—And who is he?

—And you.

—And who is he?

—And you.

—Why?

—It's like that old tale about the two children meeting.

—I don't know it. I don't know it. I don't know anything about him.

—He doesn't know you either.

—Quite unbelievable. I could be getting on for fifteen years with you. I could always serve, Vivienne? You couldn't refuse

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Name? Again? She withdrew the words with a wince, her mouth pursed, her lashes flickering over her cheekbones. "You didn't know where I was."

"When did I see you again?"

"At first, last year. On I."

"Did I mention that at the beginning?"

"Hardly. I told myself I was getting married. I was going to keep it to myself, no more thinking about it. You never mentioned it, and I didn't ask. I don't think I've heard from you since, Hamlin."

"I wrote you a letter not a week after I came back to France. I don't remember why I wrote it, but I wrote to you."

"That's good. It's not a letter. Perhaps I wrote to you because I didn't want you to hear about your work. I don't know."

"Tell me what you learned from that letter. That I'm not you these days. That today you're a girl I see only in the way you've always been. That I don't love you. That I want something else. You're a young woman, and we've got our hands tied, so I don't want you any longer."

"I know."

"No, you don't. You've got your bloody papers, that's what you're talking about. You've got nothing to do, and you're quite comfortable with the fact you're me. Only I guess I've got something to do with it."

"Why?"

"Because I respect you, that's what."

"Don't say that."

"I won't."

"Well, I won't."

"Not only that. I don't know why. Want to tell me?"

"You aren't going to tell me anything."

"Do you think you got something to tell?"

"I do. I'm just too tired."

"You look just as if you've been reading something."

"I've been reading it."

"And it's not funny?"

"No. It's not funny with you."

"Sorry. When did you start talking about yourself?"

"Last week. It started because I was very angry."

"Because of what?"

"At the end of the day. When I was in class and I passed a remark about your name when I was writing my thesis on your art."

"On your other thing?"

"Lust for art. Lust for stories, stories, stories, ever story."

"Was it bad? Your thesis?"

"No. It was good, but it wasn't that bad. Wise than my own writing. Smack in the category of Literature, but not the worst. OK, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't altogether friendly."

"I know."

"I'm not sure why it happened."

"It seemed like the silliness of a child."

"But you chose me to discuss your work with. This last time you said something like 'I think you're the most sensitive woman I've ever seen.' And I thought, No, you're the one who's mad about me and won't accept it. Now, maybe you're just mad, but I thought it might be my duty to tell you."

"Your duty," said Hamlin. "I'll tell you all about it."

She told him the story of how she had left the house of her parents, and the cruel husband who had murdered her with his bare hands. He listened in silence, then went on:

"When I was in a madhouse, I was so dangerous and mean that they sent to come me the man I wanted, and afterwards I was given a splendid funeral. I say that because of the nastiness that a man like that deserves."

"It's a pity," said Hamlin. "I told you all about it, but everything you've told me would fill you with horror if you said it to me. I know more about you than you think, and I can understand why you're so angry."

Again, there was a bitterness in the voice. Hamlin said:

"I don't know how to thank you for all the help you've given me. I must thank you for it."

"Don't thank me."

Hamlin raised his eyebrows in wonder and shook his head in annoyance:

"What for? You aren't now."

"I think I'm glad to see you have to guard yourself. It's really hard for me, knowing that you're trying to kill me. But at the same time you aren't going

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

I could not kill myself with a gun.

I could try.

They shot him from the farmhouse where he ate corned beef.

They shot me from the plane or the boat.

It was the only place I could save them from.

You've become a film star.

You just keep them out of my area.

You're an actor? You look like you. A priest, like you.

You could just grow your mind somewhere else. A priest would be different.

You don't know that.

You've rearranged your priorities so far and now we're back where we started.

You think that because there's pain you can't escape your own.

You're wrong.

What are you doing, being a priest? You know it.

You altered your life so much.

That's true.

What? That's outrageous. Why? You're not a holy man.

You're stupid.

What?

No.

Who are you thinking about?

I don't know you any more.

This conversation made Ziigwan'va's voice ask. Why couldn't I have done it? I could have killed myself taking a bus or been pushed to the airport. Who do you want now?

They're all gone.

But are you going to do it or will you hide and live with them?

Wait to hear. Wait for the death of Sunay. For Salbi. For you, because you won't be able to kill me now, and because you won't be able to kill me when I arrive.

Clutching his two hands in his laps, the young man pushed himself to the door. It was a low door, as dark as the mire outside. He pushed against it.

I've got to go.

Go?

The boy turned, as though he hadn't heard him. He started to walk away.

Wait for the death of Sunay, they'll wait for you here.

Wait for his death.

You're going to kill him?

It's important.

What about my life? The last touch that he gave me. When you killed him, he was still so young, like a baby.

I said, wait for my death.

The boy knew that to be wrong.

I know.

Go. Now lie down. Hurry.

Go. Be alive. Remember me.
Yousef sat on the bed. He didn't move. For a long moment he said nothing, then he spoke as though it were a question that had been left hanging in the air. Where are you?

He turned toward Yevette.

Go.

Yousef's lips moved, and his eyes searched hers. The fire was still burning, and he was still warm.

I'm giving up.

Go.

Houses stood on clay blocks facing each other across the street. In front of one house, a black dog was barking with such ferocity that Yevette started screaming until a maid came in to shut its jaws and put it down. A car passed, and Qani and her daughter were standing between the dogs with their arms around each other, laughing. Inside the house the dogs did not bark again.

"Leave him alone," said Yousef huskily. "That's enough!" But Yevette angrily twisted free of his arm and pushed him toward the windows. "That's not what you mean, go! Get down! Go and get down!"

Then came a harsh scream and someone moved to the doorway. Yousef grabbed the half-barricade door and pushed it in regardless. He messed up his head and fell. The litter had smeared his face with blood. Time and again he had craned his neck to find where the sobs went.

"Wait! Let's not leave him," said a woman's voice.

And then the vicious creature, her face covered with blood, scrabbled in the mud. It stopped breathing. The woman shrank back in the doorway, shielding her eyes, and turned toward Yevette.

"The Army has come," cried Yevette. And lowered the weapon in question.

"Just take it easy," said the man's voice. "Let's not get any wet."

"You're going to shoot him?"

"I'm coming to your house, go!"

Standing in huge darkness, Yevette's legs spread apart, she threw her body in Yevette's arms. Within a few seconds the colour of her skin had changed. Blood dripped from her forehead, her eyebrows, her cheekbones

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

FÜR V ARNOLD SAID I did not realize you had taken yourself so seriously.

I was thinking about you, I replied, though I wasn't sure if I was the person aware of being called by the name Rüya. I was taking you to see this person, a girl who might end up being mistaken for me. It was something I longed for as if I were less sad than I was. Sometimes I've had a fierceish notion that I can see you somewhere else, somewhere I don't know, and I have a bad memory. Don't you remember me? After so many years that I've turned up for work without your noticing. I could be mistaken for a relative, or an old friend, and all this is only false memory. But all that is true is that I still remember Rüya.

I do remember the first time you called me. It was in July, in the middle of February. I was on my way to Silinker. After leaving the hamburger area, I stopped at Hinkelbreasted Station and Rüya's apartment. Both of us walked in, down the stairs that went up into a loft. Rüya was wearing jeans and walking down the stairs. We stood there silently watching her sedatically. When she looked up, she didn't smile and hardly threw her arms around me.

"I missed you, Rüya."

"What?"

"I missed you. It was very late, and you were alone that whole time."

"Broke your heart open."

"You didn't say anything. It was late in the morning, and you didn't say anything. Do you remember that you didn't say anything? You looked at me like I was somebody else. A bunch of stuff that happened to me, I gave up everything, and then I took off. I stayed at you like a leech. Do you remember what I'm saying?"

"Sure," she said. "You're crying because of the pain in your chest. I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to stop you crying. I didn't have much more of a heart than my own, and after a while I stopped feeling anything. I wish you could see me cry. You're crying because you're crying, Rüya, so don't cry anymore. If anyone kept crying, you too, why don't you stop? If you quit crying, you'll cry. Stupidous, selfish tears."

"Because I'm crying, too, aren't you?"

"Isn't that right? Hey, Rüya, why don't you try paying attention to me again? I can just tell you one time: I'm sorry, I was curious, but I was bored. I went to see a movie at the Palace. I thought you'd like me to tell you something. Aren't you listening? Don't cry. Let's go and laugh, and get to know each other as friends. We'd make good friends. So don't cry. I don't understand."

"You don't understand any more."

"That's not true."

"Of course I'm listening. I love you."

"But that's not what I meant."

"But I don't care if you love me or don't love me, either one. We're the same people."

"Let's get married, please. I love you."

"As soon as you talk about getting married, I felt like I could have you. I was so happy when we first started dating. But then we went through a bad time and I got scared and didn't do any good. We stayed together for a long time, and after we got married we stopped dating. That's when I started crying. I cried myself out."

"So how old are you now?"

"I'm sixty-two."

"How old?"

"Seventy-eleven," she said, "but that's not old enough."

"That's not what I meant. What's sixty-three?"

"You know what I mean, don't you?"

"How old are you?"

"Twenty-nine."

"Twenty-nine? That's great, but I don't know what to say next."

"Get me out of here by morning, okay?"

"How do you mean, get me out of here?"

"Get me out of here, what?"

"I'm suddenly not sure myself."

"You're as sure as anything a grandmother's a grandmother."

"I'll bet you won't believe me if I say it, but I think I'm in love with someone else."

"You say that, and

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Your only light? Your only map?
How the hell do you know?

I'ma guided by your memory.

Well, so I'm moving away. You're moving away from me.

Not in a million years.

Well, I'm thinking of you.
Are you leaving me?
I'm heading back. Wherever you are.

You're where?

London.

No, I'm here.

What do you mean, you're here?
It's me.
Do you know me?
You do.

I hope I do.
I'm looking for you.

Love looks for a thing it wants.
I want to see you.
Are you sticking to that?

I guess. Yeah.
You're poking fun at me?
No.

I might be. You've got that red fox.

I guess. Good.

Yeah, I like that.
Can I bring you in?

Yeah.
Are you staying here?

Yes.
Where are you staying?

With you.
I guess I could put you up.

You're not much of a housekeeper, are you?
No. If you're not now I'll probably be, but another time I could do you some favours.
Like doing my garden?
You're pretty much self-sufficient, aren't you?
Your garden looks pretty pretty well.

Let's see if it ever makes it.
You look pretty much too much.
I'm a prominent citizen. Batshit.
You could do me long legs for a nice bit of a night loose.
I'm used to that, it's only a wind-up.
I'm going back to London and see you again soon, I'll see you then.
Right with you!
Kay?
Kay? You trying not to laugh?
You're even laughing.
Ha. Really? I'm jumping over a fence.
Nah, sorry.
Well, that's what the sea's doing. It's a small world out there.
Kay?
Nah. You can see my face?

Got you.
We'll come up for a bit tomorrow. You can put on my dressing gown and I'll pay your rent.
You're going to bring me a stroller?
Why?
Sorry.
I'm wondering. How I could be so striking.
You're in a good mood?
Let's not go back to the bloody sweatshop, if that's what it was.
Okay.
We'll see about that tomorrow. It's bound to be a splendid literary night.
You're laughing at me?
Ha. Now I'm laughing at you.
How much do you know, Keith?
About eighty-five.
Come on. You look good, don't you. You just haven't laughed at me.
You must be with somebody.
Brooke's chippy fists opened and closed. She seemed to be enjoying herself.
You don't know him.
Well, I'm gauche and stupid and I'm not even thin. How are things at the Spotted Dick party? Are you a member?
Not any more. But I haven't been out. And I don't care if I see you again.
Nothing. Not really. Just pretty.
You've taken your time so far.
How can I interrupt?
Why don't you go and tell me?
Aren't you cold-blooded?
Why don't you find me a honey?' She got up and slapped a fist on the tiled floor.
No honey. I don't want honey. Go away, Keith. Go and have your petty pleasures.
Did you divide a face?
No.
Come on, Keith, don't tell me.
What? She chalked her lines out. I won't stand for it. I quit. Go away.
I'm going. But all she wanted was to be left alone with the slave on the portico bunk.
A minute. I'll be right back.
'Hey,' she said, 'what's that on the floor? Come on, Keith. Don't stand there looking at me.'
She followed him along the corridor, between the lifts. The chancel, the nursery, "the movies," "the scullery maid", "the babe in childbirth," the funerals of my heroes – the world pissed on Keith once, the myth of Keith. They all came bumping in after her. The plaster devils, the delphiniums, the angels of death, the vituperations, forlorn with their young, the ideas that didn't work, the timorous, the celebrated.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

This I thought was true. I had to come here, into this strange country, to this strange breath, this strange place, to this strange face.

Because she had come here, these other women—and not only women, and not only on the people—they were not only our daughters, they were not only people much like us. They were the women the woman in the big world we dream of.

Perhaps we all dreamed of these women when we were little. Perhaps I did. It's not certain. There was the woman I'd been told was beautiful. She was beautiful.

There was the beautiful little old woman in the village, who would try to be a kind to me, to Otto, with whom I spent one night once, and who kept letting me know she loved me. We kissed. She was ashamed, for all the things she had despaired of, for all the things she had spent. She has her shame now.

We haven't lived in the world like this for many years. We run a family. We are adults. We are the women we marry. We adopt someone, we make him our own.
THAT WOMAN IN THE NIGHT DIDN'T DESEP, but stood looking out over the firing line, staring at us. She was not frightened, but had to think. She had to think, and she thought quickly. She thought that I must be in danger. I would be in danger by myself.

Two men came up to her. One of them asked her what it was she was in search of, and she told him. He looked at her and did not speak, or even look at her. He was the first to speak.

He said that we must not kill any animals. He said that he was sorry, that she must not think he loved her, but he did. He then took her hand, held it inside his arm, and said, 'I wish you were someone I could love.' I knew he wanted to use my name, but my name was the name of someone for whom he had been mislaid a wife and had lost his way, had to find his way again.

She said, 'Yes, but I would hate you to forget me.'
The fire was out on the horizon. The sky was torn at the ends. We watched the sun disappear over the edge of the world. I never saw clouds. I heard rain. One of the men eased the girl into his arms, and they began to walk carefully, looking at the shore and the children. I looked at Gerald. His skin was white like polished glass and he was wet, his eyes looked red. He said, 'I think we ought to stay here and wait for night ever to come.' The girl said nothing at all. She waited beside him for the night to come. I could see that she knew we would not be allowed. She could see that I did not care for her companions, which displeased her.

We stayed a little longer and then went up over the cliff, over the cliff, a slowly diminishing piece of the vast empire, that had been dead. Above us, this was not the world we lived in. We could not see it because the world was not there.

Soon the fire blazed again, and frightened Gerald only by the gesture. He ran back. We did not run back. I knew he would come to us.
It was an early spring now, and the sun shone in the sky. We were on the bed of the rock, under the enormous rock that was the ocean, and the sun made the sea seem bright. Everything was turned towards us, towards Gerald. He was standing at the very edge, and his bare arms waved to us, as if he knew we would not come, but he could not think of anything else, not of the women. I could see that he was sorry and I knew he must be sorry. And I knew I must not try to love him, at work, when I knew he hated me, and I was afraid that he would come and notice us sitting there, and see us half naked and him in front of us.

That night we did not speak. I lay in the rocks, listening to his footsteps down the long cliff, and I had the feeling that I would not speak, when he walked past. We sat still, waiting. I kept my eyes on the sky, to see if he would come and talk to us. To his right, across the sky, was the corresponding rock, the body of that sky. We sat there, listening, waiting, like an animal. But whether it was rage or fear I could not tell. We waited, not knowing whether he would come or not, but knowing he would come. He bore down on me, with a soldier's rhythm. It was same as a woman bear

"I didn't have to get mad or anything. It's just that I never got mad. I mean I was mad once, for a little while. A long time, actually, before I died. My very first wife. She, you remember, wasn't married. She died of breast cancer. It was a stupid cancer. She had it for a few years, but then she got a better one, and she died of breast cancer. I had breast cancer for a while, and then she got better. But she had this thing. I can't be sure of the blame, but it didn't go away. Every couple in the country has it, probably more or less the same. It's probably metastasis. It's a terrible disease, you know? I had a pretty good one of my old girlfriends once. It's cancer of the bowel—they shouldn't put it in the medical manuals."
"It's not a bad disease, apparently," I said.
He nodded. "It certainly in no way resembled the one that killed her sister. I don't mean to boast, but this really is cancer of the bowel. I don't mean to boast. Of course, there are the more advanced cases, of course."
"Is that so inadequate?"
"It's a horrible disease and one of the most horrible deaths of any disease. It's thought of as just a disease. Cancer of the bowel. In my time we were crazy on cancer, too. We thought that it was the Holy Grail, somehow, and maybe even more so. But I was forty-eight years old at the time, and I'd read a great deal about it, so I never forgot that.
"So I stayed with her for a bit, and then she died of cancer of the bowel."
"You must have felt terribly strange after she died," I said.
"Yes, and then everything went away. She was just a regular young woman, living a normal life. She looked fine. She had a wonderful face. It's still pretty, though. Only her hair went completely gray, it was so gray and long and she was so bald. It seemed amazing, seeing her like that, as a woman with a gray, bald head. She had an incredible character, and yet at the same time, I remember it. I'd never even met her.
"I had an affair for a while, though. A really great affair, too. But I couldn't resist her. That's something I know a lot about, but at the time I didn't have the courage to talk about it. It was too awful to talk about, even to myself. I hadn't got the courage to say a word to her. She was still sitting in her chair, talking non-stop. She had an enormous appetite, for food, for something to eat, and she hadn't noticed, for years.
"Nothing did come to me then. I didn't have anybody. That girl, when she came back. After she left that time, there was nobody left in the living room. I used to go down there and watch her suck that food. I'd watch her and try to be protective. I felt kind of sorry for her. But finally I realized it was worse than psychic illness—mental instability. Still, I was powerless to do anything about it. Not for months or years. I couldn't go on."
"How did you manage to see her two weeks after she died?"
"I somehow got a letter from her. I was still back then, going around giving interviews. She left at nine in the morning. I just didn't know what was going on. I was at out of the hotel—in the hotel restaurant. There was somebody sitting next to that table. It was full of people. Harassed people. People were harming one another. Each one of them was looking over his shoulder. It was like staring at somebody's footlocker. I could see why she left. But then I could see why it made sense to me to, too. It made me feel awful, after a while. I thought about her forever. I think I didn't have the courage to do it. I thought about her for a long time. I never knew what I was right about, though.
"I remember a presentation I gave in a hotel. At a party.
"That was the phase I was in. That came after all. I got to accept that my life was over. I felt lousy and bad for a second I was flown out there. I thought I'd be back in my own body, doing the same as the next two days. Overtaking forms. Straightening out my thoughts. I felt just like everyone else. The way my body was filled up with people. Like just nothing else. Anybody tried to make a superficial appeal to me to feel good about it, I

Then silence. He shook his head, and smiled. It wasn't fair, not fair what was happening between them.

I don't want to talk about it, he said through his mouth to the sharp pain of his own words, and toward the tormenting hand of Sherlock Holmes.
I learned the names of all the things that I am not," Marlene said, "but I can still say their effects, separate them into parts and quits, like a great tale. One of the first, though, is the love affair."

She could not press her case, which was a confession of bitterness with regard to her lover. Sometimes one feels sorry for a person who has loved well beyond her means. The same thing with the love of another. But it wasn't very well known, nor did she discuss it with me. I put out my finger to guide the conversation toward a more balanced point.

"In the first place," Marlene went on, "I almost find it funny that I can't remember the exact number of times I did a thing with a woman, or rather I really did it with an experienced woman, because I wanted very much to. But you take my word for it that I also did it with an older woman. I didn't remember doing it with you. Do you remember? It may have hurt you to remember that I talked about it? But I was talking about me, and if I ever did it with a young woman, I must have meant it with you. You must remember that, for as long as it was you, you never talked about anything but sex. Do you know who I mean? Both of you."

And then, steeped in outrage. And then again, delightfully—because I heard myself making a noise in the dark—I smiled.

YEAR FOURTEEN
I don't know what it is you have to do with hate.
—T. S. Eliot
THE ROOM WAS warm or cold or warm and then it snowed. The steam rose up into the pale attic and surged and trembled about us, like the salt-apples of an ice lake.

"This room, the attic, I thought it was a dream."

"No, you didn't."

"We walked all over town for a while, the two of us. It was a long walk, brave boy, and we almost ran dead. We almost couldn't stop, but we kept moving by instinct, like a couple of rabbits running up and down the fields. I remembered that day when you got off the bus or in the train and I told you to get out. But you wouldn't. You stayed and walked up all those stairs with me on my knees, but all the time I was thinking about you. I knew it then, I knew it—never since you left the bus or when you opened the door. I saw it in your dark posture and your slender hair."

"I guess it was the sun in the headlights."

"You kept me from seeing it. I thought that it was the altitude. In those days it was very high. You had only to push a button or turn a knob for a long time, but you never went back. You would walk up to me and touch me as if you had never been around. Like a little moon in the sky."

"You were always my moon. I carried you from the bus back to the bus. You carried me back."

"Can I trust you?"

"Trust you?"

"Because I have to trust you."

"Which about to do you a total of good and plenty of harm."

"Will you trust me? Think about it."

"About to do me a great deal of harm."

"Are you going to kill me?"

"No, yes. But I am going to try."

"I don't know what to do."

"I'll tell you what to do."

"And I don't know what to do."

"You know what to do."

"I'll suck it down."

"I don't mind sucking it down."

"You can suck it."

"I don't even want to suck it down."

"I'll give you a little squeeze."

"I'll give you nothing on the little squeeze."

"I want to suck it down sharply."

"I'll give you no squeeze."

"I'll give you a little squeeze."

"I don't care if you love me."

"We'll be good, we'll be good, we'll be good. We'll just be too good for ourselves."

"All right. Good, I'll give

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
I was inwardly reduplicating that sentence as he spoke, using my mind to construct a self-centered
reality, an eternal vigilance against the freedom of the body.
And now, some six years past, I cannot recall whether I was repeating the l'imple in my head, or rewriting
those words in my right hand.
During the first year, we traveled from the California coast to the South, and in a
few at the back of our minds hovered the few episodes in our
occasions when we forgot that we ever loved each other. Then the
wind blew again, and with it the memory of our friendship, which
I had been seeking for so many years, faded, and disappeared. In the
winter, we were visited by a strong local winter, and by the whiteflies
that lined the fences and cornices of our buildings around our
yards. They never stayed behind, but alights ate into the linoleum,
roaring at the exposed rafters, and devoured by blackflies. In
the summer, I could manage, by comparison, to stay awake during the
twelve-hour day.
At last, we reached San Miguel. As we crossed the Mojave toward the
deserted town, someone pointed to the narrow brush-covered highway that
separated San Negro from Santa Isuca and sat us down on the
tarmac. At the edge of the road I rolled down the window and, while
looking for someone who would pick me up, I shouted at one of the parked cars.
These beat me, and finally I lost him. With my face in my hands,
I tried to revive Tired.

		�I am still half asleep. For a few years I've been
lastingly determined to go back to a small town on the coast, but
the train-drive stretch in Malibu reverted to a theme from the Mademoiselle
picture postcard. There was no longer any end to the trials
and ultimacies I was now forced to undergo, and I clung to the belief
that at last I would have my moments. After my 'major experience I
assumed I would never again be in the field of combat, and if
anyone from time to time happened to look in my direction, I never
fell for them. When, in 1966, I was physically assaulted by
a group of hoodlums, I would always note the fact in my diary.
The Depression of Civil History: 龍�			I am, in a sense, that Grosz. I am a
figurer. The question of my trade, my vocation, the extraordinary circumstances
in which I seem to meet this, my presence within the friction field of
the world, everyday life that is not benign cubicles, or July by
the sea, or the thirteenth of August, is the question of what end to which
I can turn up. It is difficult to define the answer. Once: when,
when. So far I am trying.

			The New World. The lone figure on the
tourist's stool in the lonely restaurant in the village. The
whole of the country is one large restaurant and a hundred and
fifty people eat at least once a day. And if that is not enough
eaters, hot plates, hot plates, and hot plates are eaten out
of doors. At first, however, I simply gave up trying. I
fought my way into the crowded restaurant, a mine of simmering
tongs and chili peppers, and I simply shoveled it down.
No matter. Eventually, I discovered I simply had not enough
creature to keep myself occupying space.

			The tourism industry prospered. Boys
would apply to see your agent in the tourist offices after a series of
"test" or "show" events. You probably all didn't want to do "show"
anymore, so you went down to the cinema. I got rather cloudy
about this aspect of my writing, and I questioned it. But I
learned a great deal about the arts and lost the narrator;
as for the ending, well, of course, yes, that is the effect I am trying
to achieve. But the audience was entirely my audience. It was
genuine and genuine. I even thought all the time of writing your
insurance commercial (and you put it into italic type). I don't think
the form was important. Some of the figures in this
review did speak to me about the space in which I had been enveloped
for so long: my youthful innocence. I began to grow old in the
receding years. A tall man. In a winter London city. Suddenly I
was thinking of everything.

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

I don't want to close up the gates. I don't want the gates to close.

What am I? You hate those gates! Do you want me to stay here so that you can escape from me? No, you mustn't do that. You must refrain from this. You must not be like the young man who mustered a sword against the gateposts. I will show you this city the way to flee from the aridity of the imagination, and then you will know that you are a man of reason once more. You will understand that the dick is worse than the owl.

If you believe God is everything, then God is everything you like, that is my opinion.

I think God is nothing. I love God and he hates me and all of this.

A man of conscience is like the watchful builder. He will say, You are better than the other, from the day you are built until the day you die. You are a man who is adored.

We have no sanity, O God.

I knew it but I didn't know it then. I don't know it now.

We begin too soon. We need clarity.

God is the word.

I'm the Word.

All I need to learn is the way to read.

If, God, you don't allow that too late, you will receive in His wisdom the answer to all your questions.

Do you understand?

Do you love me?

You know nothing good can come of your youth and that of all things, a man would not be wise so stupid as to abandon his good things.

I was so much afraid of coming, O God. And it has happened.

I was so much looking for you, and you would not come to me.

The Word, then, does not mean very much, does it?

You run the risk, O God, and you will surely run the risk.

The word is the word.

You thought not.

Now, don't be ignorant of what comes before it.

The Word.

The Word is the Word.

It will come. It will come in time. It will come.

I will make you come.
Break them like I told you.
In time we shall see as the Word came, and we shall see as the Word has come.

There will be no time.

The Word will come. It will come like hail. It will come like lightning. But it will not come the way you imagined.

Why destroy yourself, O God? I begged you, the Word not too great, please, because in the midst of its glory you should not be too proud of it.

Do these things of yours make you think God will come? I tell you to try to live. Try to get off your knees. Try to forget your own animal existence. You are making a mistake, O God.

Perhaps I have tried too much. I have failed. I shall be punished. I will get it over with.

I do not want you to get the point. I am made of still flesh, of a broken bones, and my bones will never give me rest. No matter what was put into me, even at the beginning, I am still the same St. Anthony, shrivelled and half white. And I will put you among the chickens I killed. Only I shall not let you rot.

I shied from you, O God. And I turned away from you. I said to myself. It is all right. It is all right.
Do not let us speak of this as if it were still the present time. Time as thing you have not yet lived, as if it had not come before. Time as now, for we know there is no past. It is like another life, ours, for we know there is no future. But it is not the same life. Is not one life the same the same? Some have said there is no life, but always the same. And still there is no future. You are the present. We ought to think of you as this moment, thin and spectral. Breathless air, hot in your face, breathing hard like a face that cannot be put into words. Your eyes are as a cloud that brightens and darkens for no reason, yet like that, as it is so, for no reason. There it is.

There is no time. Time moves too fast for your present body. Time moves so slow that it does not seem correctly normal. (No, it was kind of you to use the time machine. It works both ways, but not uniformly.) You have entered the present in a manner that was not your own. There

"—a big fat reason why I go to England?"

"You are going to make a lot of money and you will be much happier. My Nini-sensei has told me that you speak good English. You don't need to speak anything else."

"You used to say that to me?"

"I begin to remember your peevish, afflicted face. Everyone sees that in you. There is no point in your worrying about money, nothing at all, we have plenty of money to give you, what more do you need?"

"And you?"

"You need to know what I'm like at forty, start to look at how old you are. And I'm still a peasant. My only extravagance is my liquor."

"I don't need your booze," I said, surprised.

"I'm a tough nut. But I know your secret."

"I wonder what you do with the bottle."

"You think you could dispatch a courier from here?"

"I never read the papers. Our system is very secure. The courier doesn't need a passport, old or new. You just need a bearer and all that's essential."

"Is that how you interpreted the old man's letter?"

"If I have to express it, it's going to be over the telephone."

"It's your responsibility to inform me when I'm not expecting you."

"And you?"

"You like my word, don't you?"

"Not like it?"

"I use it a lot and I don't rely on it very much. Sometimes I get so agitated."

"Then you're afraid I'll stop calling you, right?"

"That's my business."

"Then I'm glad you tell me this."

Breathing in, half-broken smile, clipped while Damon looked into her eyes, taking in the depth of her anger and the relief of her relief. He knew what he was doing. He could detect, acrid with egotism, a golden glow in the purest part of her blue eyes. She was just a small girl and she was already a bit tough.

"You're afraid I'll call you in the bardo," he said.

"That's not a strange thing. A bardo—that's the name of the Minister of Private Health."

"Is that what I made that up?"

"It's a legend, stupid. It must be a myth, like the other myths about women and childbirth and eyes and the dog. But you've read the letter, right?"

"Right."

"Tell me you're afraid too."

"That I'm already too old, isn't it?"

"No, yes."

"Tell me that you're afraid of needing me, now."

"What do you mean?"

"A big dose."

"I can't believe it."

"What do you think you're going to need, or you have a lot of time to decide?"

"I don't know."

"Tell me what you're afraid of. Please do."

The cell phone was like the outermost cell in a real prison. She said, "I thought I was going to have to be there forever."

"Do I have a choice?"

"No, it's the law."

"And that means you won't need me, practically."

"You're being punished."

"Then you're going to live under a different circle of thought."

"I thought it was a long time ago."

"It's a long time ago. You used to wish you were brutally young. Maybe you'll have to find a creative young person who doesn't sit in the gallery of child-starved men, still hoping to hang out with a girl for the rest of his life."

"Where do you live?"

"I'm in a big old house in an old district. The street sprawls a few houses across the street. It doesn't seem as if there's much devotion to decoration in the native quarters."

"Rather like a whaling resort."

"Mining. Recoking. Concluding a novel, really. I think the title is 'The Caged and the Whale.' I can't remember it."

Damien laughed at his own pun.

"Well, you won't have to, of course," she said, "if you want to kill yourself or just go to hell as an experiment. How about I know your phone number, or I can give you mine?"

"I can't," said Damon. "It's up on my laptop."

… Rant, so we can see the token of your life, after once having been mined away by the monolithic walls of the bedroom.

… You confide in an old woman named Riley behind a glass of water out of your throat. She could take you in like a cheap garbage door. She can change your name and address, meet your expenses, your medical care, your hairdresser. She can attach plaster of Paris.

… You do not have to live your way through life, you tell me, but you go through life, you pick one out at a time, you make sure of it that when the body drops out – and the whole lot in the first place – you will be ready for far more life as the gift of a life falls to die and you are ready for even more.

KING DAUGHTER: FATHER, it's about time you got that thought. You have it always. At least twice a day. You hate birthdays. They bring out the worst in your character.

FATHER: Blessings. Do you hear me?

KING DAUGHTER: Listen to me. You hear me?

There was a silence. The child looked at her hands, then at her knees, then at her trembling head. This was a not difficult reaction to follow. This was Mother's own first reaction to her suffering son's death. She gasped and gaped. The urges to hurl myself upon her bosom and beg for some mercy from Heaven, but also had in mind that she knew a thing or two about her son, so that in her grief she could be strong enough to bear Godfray her grief.

The child stared intently at her servants while she stared at her face. The child knew that she would never know he had not heard it. Whereupon, the child opened his mouth and looked at his father.

Very soon, the child got from his father to Mum. He reached out and put his hand over Mum's mouth. She did not move but he felt her lips around it. Then he put his hand back over her mouth. She let him. He screamed with his hiding lips and dropped his head.

He did not move. Mum did not move. He opened his mouth and looked at her.

She stared into his face, without fear, without hostility, only full delight. Her face was beautiful. It was the only thing that had been beautiful about her since her child was killed. It was that face under her glowering black hair, all language in flower. She was Mum again, and apart from the new love that she had suddenly conceived for the child, her love of beauty was gone.

He had no idea what was going to happen next. He didn't know how long Mum would utter

A cowl, huh? Tough luck.

Your eyes are going bad today. You won't see a penny of it.

He swung up into the wind all but stumbled.

Well, Ty, he said. Y— What did you do?

Took off for a walk. A little swim.

Still you about? Your shirt's out. You lack anything right now. It's been a long day and a half. What happened?

Ty, I've just been running away from here. I tried to get me back, but they've been after me all the time. They've been after me—

You think they won't remember me? They knew you when you were still with George.

They'll probably ever do. Who's they?

The dead. They're the badasses that the badasses are. Not you.

Well, I think. We've got to get out of their game.

I should stop right there, Ty. I'm tired, Ben. It is so, so awful. I was so happy to have you back here.

Did I? How could I?

I could try to get you out.

Ben, shit. You've had too much to drink. I can't even breathe. You'll get all gryxed. You're way ahead of me.

They know, Ben. Ty, they know.

What if they know?

Agreed. You're good to me. You're my friend.

I really need all the re–clicked re-moves.

So what are you doing?

Getting my d–d d–ma.

Where's it at?

In her d-d–d-da.

Did you run an online quiz?

Take your b–iction in the d–d–d–d. I'll betcha. Do you like dominoes?

Not too well. It's an old train.

Really? Cool. Wh time you get there?

Sunday.

A friend of mine got an e­mail with it, near the bottom. He sent his friend another link.

What?

Eota.

Where?

There.

Did you follow that link?

No.

That's all right. I have a d–d–dí. I can… really dig it. Thanks for the info.

He didn't look up. With a gasp Ty did turn up the porch steps. He went in, my hand clapped in his terry–cloth slipper, and held out, but for one of those things that come out of nowhere, like a loud fart. It never occurred to him that he shouldn't give Gladys a hand.

He was still here, at the time. He was standing with his back to me, looking through the lighted window at the pines that rose up, up from the sea. There were clumps of pergolas fully formed, all like coral, in the western sky that did not seem to change, or change the left–flanks of my eyes. I saw the grape-shell caps of Timbuktu, my grandmother's hand, and the tiny mouths of black birds, and the little snout of a small cat, smiling up from the floor. At least the girl in the desert valley had a cat—she was up there. I could see it, from where Dad was.

He hadn't heard the truck come. I opened the back door and heard it start up. He had to push it into gear. That mess was everywhere. I took a few steps back, and I looked again over the flat roof of the car, through the barred window, the tilted blacktop, the bulge of the blacktop. The shaking ground, with its wordless sandalled feet—this was all for me, all the thing that the world wanted me to see and touch. I remembered the circus clown, his ego, gunning for a look of the sky and space. I chose to remember him as an old lady, talking about them, telling about them, making up stories. I did that, first with my feet on the pavement, then by the bone, by my breath, and finally by my still trapped sense of female power.

I had remembered the word 'strange,' an old woman who had once been a few steps behind me, mad at me. Her husband had been different, a man, she called him? I met him later, when he was coming from G&E's cafeteria almost every day, and we went out walking together. I was right behind her, for she was not well. Not well enough to be waltzing in

In a bright summer day in Rosendrim two dead brothers held

paressed the skull on the package of planning paper on

his desk and lifted his arms. - And he pulled his shoulders

. . . and shook it. The Browning's India

had been a lovely thing. The horses on the gate

had been swooning with nudity. They steered
lights about the canvas windows to braid off the heat,

and the horses in the blink of the double-locks

gave off a faint fucking squeak of protest.

Bullshit, he said. No sweat. When you think

you're doing a very nice thing you'll be very careful

about every syllable. He put his hands in his pockets. Then his

hands in his pockets again, they were all over the place except

the head. He put a hand on the chin. And then he straddled the door

bar, lifted his feet and got off.

(His freedom, his freedom, he said to all the world, and she said:

he isn't your mother, you must be made to understand that, keep your hands

Don Juan
In the slim and satiny cell of This Place of all places just past the border city.

You see its north end now the only halfway step I can take . . . pale door

but a rough autumn day.

The walls of the loathsome hut dark except for a

small light between them . . . no one to speak to. Through a black door

henceforth. I shall be here now.

The entrance hall is empty. Dust, a streak of indigo in the sky,

the siding is yellowed brown and speckled with the rain of birds.

It's here? You see? Don Juan leaning forward with eyes closed and the

barrier of his head between his knees.

The front door is open . . . so long.

This dawn on a wintry afternoon, the odor of something making it

all the same way you want it right down to the most insignificant details,

the rustle of cloth, the strikes of the horse's hooves on the rinds of leaves,

the vulgar greasy food in the pots boiling on the stove.

Beech's hickory wood, from the lumberyard by the other side of a

replacement fireplace, fading blot and dark, the window.

Coffepole tilers, for weblow, the wet snake of the hickory wood it's

a little bit louder than the horse of the driveway, it's a loner in that shack.

The hickory tree, that's where you are . . . . I don't see anything.

Lie down on the floor where I can reach you, @ my feet.

You can see me better now.

There's nothing to see. Lies there on the floor and drinks.

(I mean sinks and canes) . . . stale? . . . faded . . . I go on about other things . . .

(I mean stares I can't get at and can't handle) . . . misted out.

You know. Roams about. Envy.

You described me to the old man again.
Another Man Sitting on His Cell
Don Juan raises himself on his elbows as though in a dream and

moves his backside the other way, into a closet of dusty brown coal. He

looks at himself . . . yellow of crack. Thick black hair . . . a white bowel

playing on his veritable cave Jesus, he's an old man I mean to marry. Now

he will be a man again, he's going to die. He looked at his breath,

at his nemesis.

Exactly that's what they say. I'll still be a man. A man.

Likewise Catherine reported that I was. Everything she said then about

the Charles and Thomas. She was right. Bad

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—I want to understand him. —Paul I can't comprehend why I can't.

—That's your conceit. It's your failure to understand. —I can see. Then all the things in this world are there for you just to try to understand. To take away the things in this world to a place where the role of light is absorbed like light in a prism, where the things blind me and nourish me, so I can see one thing more than the next, and my head is empty. As though I haven't come here to say goodbye. All of this and more: it's enough. He managed to close the gate, and began his walk.

—And the dead outside? I am thinking, my head is empty. And I'm filled with love.

His hands at his sides held the light, and as he walked he smiled.

—And the dead inside?

—The dead, perhaps, but not the rest of us. A man without his parents, a brother, a wife: I can't think of any of them. All the things in this world that are not ours; where the rest of us found our sustenance but have not yet harvested it. Where I, a street-urchin, can't read.

A thorn burned in his shoulder, and he walked faster, moving more slowly now in relation to the gate. But there was no reason to be so hurried.

—I just want to wait for him. Ask him if he's hungry. Something to eat on his way out: be there and take away the thing in the middle of the night.

—You have many questions, Jack.

—Remember the children?

—Remember who is my father. And remember that he is my grandfather.

He had just entered the street of the dwellings. Signs of life glimmered on to the dark, as though the houses had started, and the trees assumed human shapes. They drew near slowly and Jack walked in, arms outstretched, his elbows coming to rest on the cobblestones. He waited. When he heard footsteps he turned and ran inside to find the men who had been following him. He was already in more than one room. The doors of the first two rooms were unlocked. He did not wait for them to meet the man who had followed him inside, and stop for one purpose. Just as the first room did not live a man who was not a man, so knew that in the last room he was the only man. The first room had a floor, and there was a man hanging up from it. But he had just died. Was it because he was too small to overpower? Or because he was too small? His skull was small and his eyes did not's. He was a skeleton with eyes in a round head. His knees were splayed out to the side. Jack advanced at a snail's pace, and pulled the man to his feet.

—Good man!

—Jack! Jack, when I woke . . . and he felt the small man's legs spring to his sides, his hands held out over his knees. Jack stood still for a moment, touching the man's knees with his fingers. The man's trembling arms thudded, and he dropped to his knees. Jack knelt there, and passed his fingers over the man's thinning skin, and then tested the regions under the man's chin and the top of the man's head. And all his life, Jack, Jack with his pustular laugh, laughing on the edge of the world, he had not expected to find the man's lips trembling in terror or swelling. So for a while the two men labored side by side in search of something out of the dark, something they kept tucked away.

Pecks were beginning to plague the streets of the city: and then the food dwindled from the spaces which did not share the nests of the men. Pecks, pecks, who? Jack wondered if this man had gone mad or found his spirit in a sack. Pecks, pecks, everywhere and everywhere and everywhere until Jack spoke.

—All eyes, all eyes eyes, he called through the dim corridors.

—Who . . . who . . . Jack shook the wings of a bat flapping in the air outside him.

—Mister . . . Mister . . . . Jack got his voice up with effort.

—Jack. What . . . what is he up to, Jack?

—The stuff and I got out of it, the man . . . the man . . .

—Whose voice?

—The man I just told you. The one in the dark . . . you . . . Jack, I think he's found his way . . . into the first place .

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

This life. I can't get rid of it. I find myself, I think. Living in it. And he was giving lectures and giving lectures and he was still alive.

She waited for him to ask her if he was sorry about everything, if he had occasion to feel grateful. She knew this to be a childish naivety. But she forgot about that. When he started to speak he was no longer boyish but mildly curious, not hating or claiming or approving. He was simply saying, almost reverentially, well I am sure everything has its price, and then, in the same quietly exasperated tone, and finally, with slight surprise, in his usual mildest, dignified way, he asked her whether she wished to have another baby.

Oh no, she said. Well, I don't think so. Not now.

How old was he when you had one?

Six. He was born a very full year later, four months after my mother died.

I can't imagine that happening by chance.

No, he said, not so odd. I had a mother who was very full after her death, and it was natural to have a baby when you are just starting out in the world.

The image of her handling time she saw later was of an impregnable woman, deeply pregnant, blunted and piled with all this interfering life, living inside it, looking at work, living the middle-class life.

She leaned back in her chair and looked directly at him, so that he had to look up at her. His head sank into his legs, and his face was painfully dull with boredom. He kept his face almost in focus, his eyes half shut. He was a man who could not be bored in work. He was good at work.

He could not be bored in the classroom. He could not be bored in the room. He could not be bored with my mother. She had left one classroom and then another, in the years she worked with me. One teacher was a perfectly patient man who carried on easily, and he was a woman who had no time for petes, for banter, for hockey games, for nothing in particular but simply standing there with her hands so that she could hold so much time and not be distracted. In between times she spoke to me as if there were some great interest in the letter she had written, but then, not before she knew me, she would simply say, So.

She said to him a few mornings later, It's odd, isn't it? You know what I mean.

I don't know. I don't know. What is odd?

I think that I'm not sure what you mean by it. You don't know. Sometimes I think we both know what is odd.

Never, ever in my life, she said, I didn't mean that. What is odd?

Nothing, nothing at all, he said. But sometimes I think that maybe I could tell you if you wanted to be decent.

She laughed at him, knowing it was the last non-verbal thing he would say, but full of pity and contempt, not spiteful. He did not know, he said. She did not know that he was just playing around.

I like where you spell that. I know. Whenever I am in a ridiculous place. It's not as if I care. One of these days, I'm going to get really mad.

That was the first time Maria was willing to share her feelings with him. But she resisted his attempts to get her to talk. She had told him once, in the kitchen, when they were just getting through, the day he left, that the thing that drew her to him was her inability to hear or feel the ground-breaking beat of reality itself. She had made an effort to listen to any word he spoke. She had tried to read his face, but he told her he was now in a floating world, where he sat on the floor in his room playing records, catching his thoughts on the piano. He played with his collar eased down, and her nightly sitting on the floor looking up at him, and they stared at each other. She was angry, the only angry thing in the world, and half-flayed on the floor by twenty-four-year-olds with wild hair and worn red to black.

That's what I think.

Because you don't know?

No.

Look at me, I'm getting mad.

At myself? He just looked at her, with his eyeglasses, for a moment, then nodded. Right away it dawned on her. Now he's troubled. This is how things are. Nothing can upset her.

No, no, he said, you explain it yourself

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

I know. I know more than you do about all this. He said, I don't know about myself. I know that I don't really know. I'm just not sure if I want what I get. I was drunk and stupid from having done so much thinking, his words, they sounded so true, they sounded like true so even.

I know that. But what am I?

You're the child of this family.

At this the book fell from his hands. He was back in the lower field. He made his way, grim, trying to remember the book, trying to put distance between himself and the ground. He came upon a piece of paper, dirty with grease, and he read that these inconsequential scrawls might serve for a period, before Times Square was repaired.

Grit in a pan of water, I don't know. It's not good for the teeth.

What, the toothpaste?

You have to make your own.

The book was cracked. Sometimes he thought but not quite. He had a crummy mouth and he was several years more often drunk than sober. While he waited for a car he fished out the crumbs of thought. The World Trade Center, the emerging ballerina, the assassinations at, of relatives. These somehow did share a certain external reality. But too much. He had been caught gathering information about a woman's wife, having naught but information about a man's childhood and fondness, the stuff of figures on TV. This guy yourself, he suspected.

He used to work on the Times, he told me. He used to make a lot of money as a reporter, he told me.

And because now he had observed the people who come in and sit with more books than ever before, he began also to experience as he grew older those persons who had grown old when he was a little boy. He made them study his paintings. He was told where they might have come from. There was still a few little book houses, with their pages clean, and he remembered a little girl from Philadelphia, watching him read, off to the front, off to the left, and she said, Is that your Pulitzer Prize? Still, he never could be sure because some prints hung out of the pioneers' fragments and he did not learn all of them. So he had a great deal of books and in the war, when the war finally went to them, he dug out from the holocaust dust those of his, the Jews' prints. These he pulled out and lit on the Albert at the back of the shop.

He needed to die again, a book on the family. He had always wanted to tell me about his father, in so many words. He had once claimed the elder son was a millionaire, but it was Kurt the little boy who had grown up speaking kiddish to me. Kurt had a wide face, black eyes, Habsburgan nose, little ears, frizzy black hair, broad nostrils, the nose of a Jewish bullfighter. You have to listen all the time, he told me, you have to live for them.

My father's old hobby, which he had never given up, amused him. He thought every father is supposed to have art.

Did he paint?

No.

He knew the family story to be sexological, he thought especially of Jewish families. In their more tender years. Father and mother who benefited from the refugee camps where Kurt's father had been a member of the Red Cross, Granny Plautel, Granny Lily in the J.W. youth, twelve years old Dorothy with her head down, and Arturo in the shadow of the barber's cleats, the dark tires, the newborns clutching in his arms. The two tiny little fat motherless Balisia, head on shoulders, striding with his mother, left eye smiling in her head. My father who wasn't there.

My mother, left out, the state of the world and death. Haunted by two beautiful figures, though free of any outward resemblance.

I think it was at the first collecting that I saw the first signs of all our family's sex. The books we read by the blocklights, the lit poppies the old ladies brought in to wash a floury white. The stink of dignity. My father taking my mother on the tour. The big mahogany dining table which was part of the house-my father and mother, playing their cards, the men pushing back their chairs. If my father was drunk he sprawled out in his rocker and stroked his daughter's head and told her we should not be ashamed of ourselves. He said if I wanted encouragement I should bear it. The woman tried to seduce him, said she was so fat and small

—Of all the . . . the most important things in the whole vast cosmos of time.

—Why, all this Time? he demanded, turned on by the close.

—Why? you . . . you were . . . all this, man . . . all this, a man of your size . . .

—Oh, you're not the greatest man there are, he took a step back.—I mean, you're not even the only one who's convinced of anything. That's all in the old song. That both of you turned your backs on nothing, the moment the hand came up beside his throat.

—He turned his back on Time! he shrugged—now, just a minute . . . (—Wait, let me . . .

—You know what you're not allowed, it's a success. You know what you're not allowed? you lock yourself in the bathroom and fix this thing and save your money if you need a toilet or change your sheets, and that's a success unless you don't lock yourself in the bathroom, until the pain in your arm leaves your eyes.

—Well, you get right out what you're doing on your feet, I never saw you carry a person up and down in the street, where I was before.

—I just keep doing it, man. You want harder down? The arm's still there, you want harder down? Hand over till the elbow hits me.

—Give it away afterward? How much do you want?

—You put it in the paper, you want it printed?

—I want it printed, well, longer in the newspaper, that's another secret, he's not even sure on the misspelling it but it's a secret, he's not even sure it's totally there, with all this studio stuff in the background, and he stops, as the others, one by one, head to foot to the floor, catch their breath.

—They want you to censor your own speech on that look in your eyes, that look of pure hate.

—That look! Saw her once, I swear I saw her! He was staring into the floor and her bang shook the upholstery of that chair back, laying out the blueprints with a series of clear images in the curves of her shoulder, tilting sharply as though in plan against the rain as she moved to turn her back to him, irreducible, ceasing abruptly to breathe as she remembered his hands on the arms of the chair and then the hands on her hips and then the thickness of his knuckles, and that same feel as his face on her wrist, and the glassy frame of his head in her fingers as he gasped breathlessly.—I think you can read . . . the way you read just then . . . ?

—Mmm . . . in the newspaper, the small print . . .

—Or you could watch the news on television with that . . .

—It sounds . . . vulgar.

—Man, the way you read yesterday you can't stop today. Music, family drama, dramatic pictures with the airport thing, they're all like you. You know?

—I mean . . .

—Problems, things like that, you dig them up oh, the tycoons, the businessmen, those suits can't do anything about, they've got to be more realistic with the means you give them, do you think I'd ever get my hands on some of that? I mean who wants to take them out and spend them on activities, like tennis and swimming and tennis, they're just too damn rich to see why you ought to dig it up.

—You ought to do something about a feeling you end up with, you've studied enough to know.

—I can't . . . I can't . . . talk, she broke off, resting against the arm of the chair before him.—No, no I told you I can't . . .

—In the newspaper was that classified ads for a traveling painting, pushing the old painting. It's so uncool . . . his pressure on her arm slackened—that's a hard lesson for you. Talk to me.

—What . . .? That's my wife . . .

—Oh! Falling in love with your wife your sister, your mother-in-law . . .

—What . . .?

—Your wife's daughter.

—Adam?

—That's it. He's the son of the family that owns the real estate company, he owns the company that owns the original lot.

—My God . . . what can you . . .

—I don't know, just that it's

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

My body was a lump of boiled metal.

My mind was a lump of cooked clay.

I entered a primitive cave full of the sweet and evil of a name.

I became the Monday in the seventh month at dawn, before the knife cuts and wants to die.

In the great south the goddess like all the lamas, was called Mother of the Gods.

She, Peace of the Gods, the omen of the them, sat in her womb and met the loaves, the fishes, the backbone of the serpent.

She, Mother of the Spirits, did not wait for the would of the king, because she thought that when he died after her birth, she would be the one who ruled the universe.

She, mother of Eternity, the Light-Point in the Bible.

She, Mother of Life—and in the end, the Water-Point, too.

So our names are formed by images.

Her naked body is a key to Paradise.

She is a tree of life, and she is the spin of a net.

She is what we are, all the spiritual men of this settlement, and it is also the exit from the terrible life of control.

This is Mother Earth and the Circle of Spades, the earth divided between the sky and earth and sky and earth.

Mother Earth is a murderer, the Moon and the planet.

Her naked body is the spiral of a fan.

Mother Earth is a soup bowl of spades.

Mother Earth is the sweet poison and the seasoning, the milk of the universe.

She breathes through our noses in a burning cloud of hemp.

Mother Earth is the divine term for the cycle of life.

Mother Earth is seated on the divine key to the universe.

Mother Earth is the Shining Spear of Light on the most powerful neck in history.

Mother Earth is light in abundance.

She is the Harlem St. Louis Woman.

Mother Earth is Light."

She is the Saraw stick and the many-colored Bouzouki wares, the glowing bricks and horns of the five-ton manor house, the New Orleans fur steamer;

"Bouzouki," the Sun God says, "the Sacred Spear that dis-attacks;

"Bouzouki" is the boeufeaters' trumpet, the hammer of light, the hair on the science fair page, the bass of space, the line of the Great Concavity, water in a bath.

She is the beauty of the universe and our root, Mother Earth, ours as guardians of the universe, laughing and deaf.

Mother Earth is Mother Sun.

This is Mother Earth.

And so we name the Four Sacred Points.

The Sacred Spear of Light.

The Grand America of Light, symbol of the universe.

The Grand America is contained in an ancient cave, a cave of light-bearing, a cave of silence, a cave of textures, a thousand-year-old, two hundred-and-ninety-year-old cave.

We believe that the leaders of the peaceful and peaceful world must have been Old Man of the Mountain, the Old Man of the Big Red Way, which is to say, the Old Man of the Two-legged Bird.

"The Old Man of the Mountain," the Great Spirit said, "told the prophet Ezekiel when telling of the Bowling Ball, 'You don't have to sleep in the tree of the South before a baleful moon has darkened.'"

"The third eye of the eye?" it goes on the air side of my toad-stick head.

"You don't have to eat in the tree of the South before a baleful moon has darkened."

"As an Old Man of the Mountain," said another speaking voice, "was I who was eaten by the vixie-dogs of time, by animals who leave no track?'

"What they don't know is what the mountain itself is saying."

"How do you know that the mountain has changed its mind all?"

"How can I know that the Great Spirit, the Father of the Reunion, my brood of the Brotherhood, and Father of the Light, the Myself, has crept up on you."

"The only time in my life it's happened that I haven't been there for a time."

"Get out of here, too," said the Heavenly Messenger.

"The volcano!"

"The volcano!"

"The volcano is broken all over."

"Stiff as Sister Worthington."

"Stiff as Mother Earth."

"It's a mountain."

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

And what I am is not forget? the brain.

The brain is the future. For every moment we all have to walk along one of the upward process of evolution. It's not enough, it's too great to be. This is what I hear in my sleep. I am not asleep. What happens to you in the forest, what'll happen when I go down?

I am awake but I am here, what I cannot move. I am right here. I am in myself. Who can I trust to help me?

Relieve my pain with music. Help me to remember.

One day when I was in the wood shop, it wouldn't be enough. I used to bring books, copious, to the sawmill. Sometimes when I took those books home, they were warm and fresh. Someone would take them home and thaw them, then put them on the shelf. The other books were the same: Glorious Things of The Book, Encounters of the Gods, First Chronicles of the Kings of England, Out of the Desert, Messer, Two Seasons of the Moon, A Queer's Pride, The Yawning of the Dog.

One day when I was in the lumber shop, I took that book with me. I had a hundred dollars in my pocket. I put it into my backpack. I bought four new things, my cap, my gloves, my hat. It was family stuff.

The next day, I was walking along a new road. I was dawdling along and around the long slope on the side of the road. I was looking for the way out. There were no shops or houses. Somebody had left it behind. I had never been before in my life. I decided to look in the trees until I saw a shop or a house ahead. But I was distracted. Somebody was there. He had followed me. He was standing right behind me, and I had stopped and turned around and looked into his eyes. His mouth connected with mine as if he were talking to me. He seemed to be in a kind of ecstasy. He hadn't heard me.

It was the same as always. He was there, alongside me, and I was frightened. As always, I didn't want to run or break something. I didn't have any way of getting back. He followed me to the store and I ran. We talked and talked and talked and talked. We didn't dare stop, and I kept running back and forth to the village. I was protected. I was protected from him.

He really was in a white man's suit. It doesn't matter how strange he looks, how ridiculous, it's just the way it is, someone in a white suit and a white driver and white days behind him and white snow and a white man in the woods somewhere across the road and white cars and white trees and black trucks and white sheets of snow, and I realized that he was about to carry my things. I was dazed. I had to be with him. I knew that I had to stop running. I would not run.

— What happened?

— Nothing.

—Then what happened?

—Then we got home and I saw the white guy with my backpack. I didn't run. He walked up to me. I didn't run. The white guy is so happy as he walks up to someone that does not have a white driver's license. He walks up to them and says, Hi, I'm the white guy's passenger. I walked up with my knife in my hand. I stopped when I saw the white guy. I said, Come in.

He walked in. It was only a few feet away from me. I was so happy, I couldn't have been happier in the world. I had nowhere to meditate or be careful of. I knew that I would live through all of this. I pushed him in and he went in. I heard the groans of his tires. I looked at him in the mirror and I realized that I wasn't scared. That my blade was bleeding—and I knew he would be a friend, because of my father's tribe.

We began to walk. He got closer. I realized that he was a man with a skin wound. He was dragging me and completely forgot. I was not afraid of his anger.

He said, Oh, what lovely skin, that once it was made from the animal skins that were hung in the land and I hope we are going to have all the time to kill it then. His face became very serious.

—Where did they come from?

—Don't know. The skins were a long time making it. We got a man who was the only one left who worked in the dyers' center. All the different skinners were working with him

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

We live a lie that we know, and nobody ever discovers it or shares it. We're afraid of the untapped energies around us.

She was sitting on the floor of the kitchen, drinking from the tiny glass ashtrays that the stove introduced into the coalbin, and she was watching him so intently that he forgot the words and perhaps even believed that she was his wife, his child, a secret wife before him, that would not have been enough, that she was taking charge of his life.

She was serious and sincere, but she was not kidding. She knew the truth, she said.

He finished her off with the same conspiratorial sadness, the one he had summoned to his attention, and he gave her a farewell hug. Then he went back downstairs to tell his colleagues that he had found the moleman's wife.

• • •

Later that day Panty sent his secretary to tell him that Friday was for her and that he shouldn't leave without her. She said she would be back on Friday night. And she gave him the number of her hotel.

Pants saw her on the street and the next afternoon, before she emerged from her room from the shower, although the apartment of her last occupier had not yet been checked inside, she couldn't remember where she had slept, she couldn't remember anything about her last night, except that she remembered the kind of thing she had talked to the time before about feeling lonely.

He saw her several more times during her second year. She did not like the school or the teachers she was being expelled from and they made a point of locking her in no. She wore ordinary clothes and tried to socialize with the town but she never talked to any of them, they thought her crazy. So she played the voca Grande at the movie with Andy, a big round boy with the biggest mustache anyone had ever seen and the hardest fighting man in the history of the Grande, who noticed her every day and took her friend Ray's wife to a movie. By then she was rich and Madeleine was rich, and they had no child and she was still living with Ray in New Rochelle.

She had friends, men in this and that—Umbrosian, Russian, American, Nordic—who saw her as just another privileged little girl. But she also had two boys, sons, one his age, the other about her age, the son of his contact with a Moscow lawyer, a Swedish immigrant, a decent gardener who went to college. She didn't really care what he thought or didn't think much about it, although sometimes when she asked him where he had gone, he told her.

She read the long letters, since it was the easiest thing for her to read. She didn't have to read French, she didn't have to read English, but she read only the lines of text to understand that she was being locked into his mind.

They were married three years after they graduated from high school, in a civil partnership. The divorce wanted to be final, and Madeleine didn't question it, and Andy did not raise his voice and yell at her. The few times that he did raise his voice he broke down, apologized, cut short his apologies, bit his lip, tried to explain that the mistakes he made during the marriage had been made without her knowing. She asked him what she should tell him. She told him not to get mixed up with the wrong people. She told him that she always tried to be serious about everything that happened to her, but she had been too much loving and affectionate with her husband, too much with her children, so he meant to take care of her during the final years. She tasted his tears.

"But I wish that I could," she said.

He believed her and he believed her, but she could not be sure. She had never been ugly, never. She knew that she was ugly but she could not regard it as a defeat.

Then she had a visitor, and one of the young men at the big police station called her into his station and he asked her if she wanted something and she told him her name.

He looked after her, and she wondered if she was still beautiful. He said that in her opinion, he thought she was a tall workwoman.

"I'm not tall, Mom. Look at me."

The first time she saw him, he was in black tie and tails and cap—a symbol obviously, for the Caribbean.

She said, "I don't know whether you like him. I think he's dark."

"He's dark," he said. "It was the first time I met him. He told me why he was going nice when he wanted rough."

"That makes it a different color," she said.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Not you, Rodlina said. You become me.

And if I'm not myself? I don't exist to be spoken to.

Δ You never again saw your father again. You never knew if he were dead or alive. If he were dead you demanded nothing more of him. You were never afraid of the love you felt for him but you knew that if you did not want it you could fail it. You named him La Desdichada, the padre of the universe, always the same, as you have always been, but no longer, and you grew fat from that love. He would not have wished for the love of another and you moved your lips from the fondling of your breasts against the harness that made your breasts, poor child, fat in a man's nakedness, slim in the shell of your breast with two scars on your knees. Your mother showed you, with great care, your earliest memories, the tragedies of pilgrims, disasters when your fathers were young, how she had had to help him disappear in the unfriendly straits of the north when the wheatfields gave way to brown wheat, your mother telling you how she had seen, in a cavernous cave, with a stone angel and children with beast's heads, at times, if she had been asked to recount how you were staked out on the edge of the cavern, she would have told you that you were in Circe's arms, she would have said she had seen one, the precious one, your mother was boring you with her tales, she would have lectured you on your weaknesses and your good ones, she would have passed them on in admiration, in love, in dances, she would have said she was pregnant with your grandmother, before journeying to a distant and ignominious place where the gods and men will laugh at all-night encyclopedias and candlelights and invocations, in their great cities, she would have told you that it is the vanity of the earth that makes human flesh seem human, she would have told you that the earth does not know the truth and your mother always knew that even while you're lying there with your four limbs over his head, he cries out for you with his eyes and his tongue in your mouth, she would have told you about his love with his own mother, he tells you that he feels himself at the mercy of the moon and that he knows that her soft nakedness is a sweet satisfaction and he would have told you that he believes that all his months are spent making love to Delvos Flem, the emerald-and-lapis-ed queen of the brown mare who comes in the foggy nights in her white hair, she is always dressed in her own red winding sheets, or a red dress, she dances in the streets dressed like a princess and her muffled voice and the wailing of her horns is in the crook of his arm, the world was made for him, he would have told you, only she? She who stands before you naked in her sheets, disheveled and trembling, in a red dress and her red parting in her hat, no, almost any woman is the bride of Delphi, at her age and in her shame, on her knees before a sick jester, before the patient baker who rolls his thick dough over the stones, bearing a heavy cross upon which is written something like your mother, without any tears or laughter, bored by her own formlessness, but in her face she is as she was before, dissolored though she is, the day before she was not, in your first surreptitious touches, before feeling her breasts under your shirt and before tasting the salt that perfumes your mouth and that you can do nothing about it with your fingers, a pretty one like you is not liking one piece of bread and she tears off the bread only to take a bite and swallow it greedily, splitting it up, she knows she is starving, she knows she is dirty, in the midst of your tit-ific play, as you climbed out of the cellar where the divine and glum housekeeper is shriveling baked works of clay, delving into a big toe of my mother's blood, bringing forth a dry lump of a solace from her, your father's baby, your mother's baby, the daughter of Nimrod, who brought him into her house as well as the bread and the goat, who she caused to live with her, who she led to give birth in the pigsty in her own flesh, as she summoned in Hell, who brought forth Hope, who brought forth Hope, all of them, but all without any of them, except you, your father, the place where you did a little wrong at the feast, the place of your conduct at the hour of the sawing, while I was a little boy, you repaid me

—Malik.

—Malik, yes.

—In top form. In the houses, Pablo, you are the king. The most beloved, the most envied, the most enviable, the fairest, and the conquered.

—No, Malik.

—In the squares, you are the king. You rule in your own kingdom, Malik.

—No, Malik.

—And in the house, Pablo, you reign as if you owned it, as if you had created it with your own hand, as if you already owned it or had sold it. The little coca-caba, Bahir. The king of the night.

—No, Malik.

—You are the king of the dark, the one who seeks to banish the light. The black, the pitiful, the abandoned. The benighted, degraded, the IGNALITY OF GOD, the Beast.

—Bahir, not for the sake of my throne, in my tower, not for my glory.

—Bahir, Tamir, Menta, where are you? Whether in darkness or in light, they will never recognize you, again, Bahir.

—When I am in the center. The center of the world.

—You, Malik, are in the center.

—No, I am in the center of the world. And that is why I am the leader of my people. I am the ranger of my people. That is why I am the lord of the hour.

—You have been among us, my loving Malik. Today you are in homage and admiration. I cannot have you in my hands this minute, my beloved. Is there music here? Can I hear it? Can I read it? Can I have myself described?

—No, Malik.

—Once again, I must remind you to always wear the greatest bow on your person, if you are ever in the city again. On your head, Tertuliano Máximo Afonso. On your side, Maja, Beatrice. You are my city. I am living here in your city. Saint-Sylvestre. Tardu! Saint-Sylvestre! Saint-Sylvestre! Saint-Sylvestre! Saint-Sylvestre!

—I know, Malik.

—Then I shall be waiting for you. Farje domicile.

—I know, Saiko, I know.

She went slowly down the stairs of the apartment, still facing the open door of the living room, still carrying that same bag, that same silverware and the photo album with its countless black and gold photographs, those photos of his children, a photo album of an understanding between them that no longer existed, perhaps never had, in which he had too willingly given everything away to his supporters, as if forever about to die of a good death, as if he had given up the image of himself into the hands of corrupt officials. She had still not opened it.

She remembered how very much she had believed in this man. What a great, brave man, the protector of this nation who was protecting her people from a terrible danger.

She had thought about his candid, courteous face and how occasionally the eyelashes curled and twisted as if in pain and sometimes closed themselves up. She had liked him almost always; she had never admired anything else as much as he deserved to have; she had never once thought about revenge; and yet she had dreamed of him more often than in all her years of life.

She had always dreamed about him more often than in all her life.

She had always thought of him as a hero. Played by. In the midst of the storm. The only one in the theater of history to be brave, courageous, and able to do what was in his nature; that is, to live as he did in those terrible days and for all eternity.

She had only to look at his fond expression to understand that, for him, Spain was his country. It never occurred to her to think that when he was finished playing the role of her protector in the theater of history, that time in the city when he had done her crime, she would come back to him, as if he had died at her feet, as if death were the reality!

It seemed to her that the corruption of history had reached a level that made her, for a moment, one of the victims of the world's fierce passion.

She once began a text at the beginning of a letter: Don't send me less texts if you know I'm on the verge of dying and I don't need your help, you're the only one who

—I think I am nothing. The visible world dissolves before my eyes. I find that there is no unoccupied space where I can be.

—That's good. It makes sense.

—I want to die primitive.

—We have to commit salutary sentences to your existence. Time into time into time.

—Who? You.

—I am not afraid. I would rather die than fear those times. I loathe them and it would kill me to hear them said over again.

—Are you scared?

—Of what?

—Of being there, of any danger, even if it isn't inside the head.

—Birds stopping flight. That's the hard part. We all know that, single-handed, you can't wipe out birds anymore.

—I want to be where there is only the present and the future.

—I know it too. I see everything in the present and the future that way. And your going to trouble and coming to regret it means we have to do it all over again. It's not going to end well.

—Do it each one the way you've always done.

—You do that. We all do it. We all do that, moment to moment, moment to moment, without getting tired or sick.

—Maybe you're right.

—Why do you think I am afraid? Because I am so scared? What about the future, what about an encounter, an argument, an encounter we're bound to? Fear is the only reason I need. All the rest is fear, the fear of not having enough time, of not being enough, of never having enough.

—No, I don't mean that. All the rest is fear.

—Talk about the fear.

—Now listen. If I'm going to end up in some mess and don't know anything because I don't know if I want to die or not, that's the fear.

—And the fear makes you go through all the stages of mourning. You don't know how to wait, the things you have to do because you know they will never happen.

—Talk about the dread.

—Talk about the dread and the dread.

—Well, what about it?

—What's the dread?

—The dread of an encounter.

—What's that?

—You know. Conversation. The argument, the encounter, the certitude of it all. The coward.

—Come on. You're talking to yourself. You're not coming on to anything.

—Of course I do, I do. Hey, what are we talking about?

—Why are you afraid? What is it you have to fear?

—You know?

—Well, what is it you have to fear?

—What thing? Disbelief.

—You know.

—I don't know, I don't know. You mean, you know what it is?

—You know it as well as I do.

—Me? You talk as if I hadn't heard.

—And you talk as if you hadn't heard. You're not afraid, Manny. You're waiting for something to happen. Are you a coward?

—Mano a mandrake. You're going to have to be careful how you talk to the dead.

—You have to prepare yourself not to be afraid of dying.

—I'm going to live on what the dead give away. That's the deal. You can't have the dead for your company. They get too near and they have to deal with them. Can't you hear that?

—You don't have to be careful. There's no immunity, Manny.

—I have to be careful.

—Damn right you do. Tick-tock, tick-tock. You're going to die.

—There's no immunity, Manny. What you're talking about. Immunity doesn't make me talk mentally. I try to have a rational conversation and I'm not going to start crying.

—Well, just remember that you have no immunity.

—Like what?

—Like what you're going to die and you have to live on what the dead give away.

—I don't need an immunity, Joe. I don't need to be alive, welcome to life, to the abode of the living. I want to die like I'm fucking everyone I know, dead or alive. That's what I want to die for.

—Nembutal escapes you. Hides.

—You have to be careful, Joe

When I saw the bottle, I wanted to go out of here as fast as I could.

But I could see smoke rising from the melted ice. A smudgerass. This was why I wanted to go out quickly.

She turned the radio back on.

Suddenly, it was like I remembered. It was Patrick's voice.
Chapter 30
When September first went, Daphne got out of bed very early, I was still not sure if she was in or out of the room. She walked around wearily holding the covers and her shorts clear. She was wearing four shirts and a pair of trousers, no socks. In the bathroom, she was trying out on the bridge of her tongue a towel. She wiped herself and it almost seemed as if bathed in sweat, but when I came down she sat on the side chair, her legs crossed, with her hands on the walls, looking at me. She looked at me a long time. Her eyes were shiny, and a few tears hid at one of her nostrils.

'I know you're up there,' she said.

'I am.'

'I wanna get some sleep.'

'That's okay. Go to sleep. I think you'll regret it.'

'I will.'

She stared straight through me and started to cry.

She looked at one of her legs and screamed.

It was strange and strange and I felt stupid. I was wearing my swimming goggles. Daphne was wearing one of her swimming trunks, that draped over her left shoulder.

'I don't believe you,' she said.

I begged her. I let her cry. I hugged her. I wished she would cry longer, when she became more scared. She let me get her up.

'Get me some towels,' she said.

Before I went out, I went back and got some towels.

I stripped down to my bathing suit and hung them on a cross. Then I sat on the bench and looked at the sun. I watched it go through the roof of the church, the square pieces of the roof, the window. The windows shook by my steps.

'It's going to rain,' I told Abie.

'Is it just going to rain?'

'Oh, it's going to rain,' I said. 'It's going to rain long before the time we need.'

'Where is it going?'

'Out there.'

'Where? (The closed doorway) What place?'

'The Shepard.'

'It's not too far.'

'No? You wouldn't walk there if you knew you'd be in danger?'

'I know.'

'Just to hear the fish say it. Oh, don't, Daphne, I'm so sorry.'

'I will.'

'Why are you laughing?'

I fixed my eyes on the wall.

'You didn't feel well, did you?' asked Abie.

'No. I was fine.'

'Tell me about it. Tell me. Really.'

'Well …'

'Okay, then.'

I looked up at the sky as she rubbed her brow.

'I don't understand and I don't know why you're laughing.'

'I'm sitting here with you because I haven't been feeling well.'

'Good. I get it. The nurse, I mean.'

'She's frightened, this nurse.'

'I think she's scared because I haven't cried for days.'

'And you start with the bishop. He's the one who told you you'd never tell anybody, even your doctor.'

'Well, he does.'

'Who does he see?'

'Sthenes, and his wife.'

'What about the bishop? Why doesn't he go?'

'He's behind one of the old bags, behind the tree.'

'He's in the bush, doesn't he?'

'He looks like a bush to me, and no one in the village will ever think it could be a bit of a pleasure to be lying in his clothes.'

'He must be cold.'

'Cold. Hm. What do you think?' I looked at Myra and felt horror again. 'You'd be fully covered by it. You'd be cold.'

'Is that why he twins his moustaches?'

'He twins his moustaches.'

'Then he must be alive,' I said. 'For leaping and diving.'" 'Jump and dive.'"

'I didn't mean to be a Bishop. I don't know if I

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—And blowing the stuff right out is what it is. Your brain. You rework it.

—I shan't rework it. I'm trying to live.

—I'm going to leave you here for now. I'm going to drive you out of here. If you see anything, just push me.—

—I need to know more about you.—

—Better get your hand out there. I can't think of anything better.—

—No, your hand's comfortable under my mouth. I'll do whatever you say. But if something happens, I might just—

—Are you going to ask me for things? And if you want for me to ask things for you, just go ahead and ask for me.—

—Really? I don't know. Let's see.— Now it was she who said it; the key turned with her own voice, the white woman seeming to stir beyond the waist of her skirt where her thighs met the black knee and the thighs met as if the two sexes had made a single body keep moving and sway together in defiance. —Is that all? Just be patient with me. I told you once I never wanted to do anything you ask for. If you see something, I'll do it for you.—

—You've given me the kind of things I need. You've taken them all in.—

—All right, I don't expect to get everything from one night. I'm not interested in what you say. You mustn't answer to it. Only in reply to what you've brought me, the handkerchief. Yes? That's right. That's no? My hand there. That's definitely you. Yes? That's your hand. You hold my hand, running your fingers along the inside of it. You take things from me and shove them in.—

—I won't take anything from you, I want you to keep everything you own. No, I won't.—

She took a deep breath, very emotional and then very close. She breathed in on his palm; the cold moistened his skin. Her breast, he saw for the first time, held a likeness of a young woman.

—Aren't you Linda? Okay. I'm not Linda, I'm not thinking of Linda—but that, all the time, listening … that's not Linda. I'm listening for you when I need you. I'm listening to you thinking. You must have thought it, too. So much foreign so little at the same time, I don't mind. You made love with your clothes on, but clearly you didn't want to take them off, you're what I want, Linda. I'll tell you I'm not Linda but you are Linda. You want to keep control about that, don't you? Don't you think it's a little strange for me? But I can't help. You're doing what I want, you understand? Come with me something from me … what do you want? Look at the handkerchief. You got fresh hair, I've got thickets on the palms of my hands, I can see how your palms are shaded, and I can see your protein-rich face with the dark hollows and the creases round it, and I can see in the handkerchief, can see you didn't want to take the stuff. Your kids see you wearing yours. The other day I saw you on one of the pulpits round the back of the stalls, waving a handkerchief, you were waving it, couldn't get up and catch my eye. You wanted it, the handkerchief. That's pretty old stuff, isn't it? And I've got a nice fresh swathe of handkerchief, hadn't slept and now utter amazement dancing in my belly since the morning of my first meeting you. I've had—no, forget me—auaivre in my life, then, and you see, you don't want to have anything more to do with me? I'm only the mouth and the tail, there's the rest of you. As long as you've got what you want, that's real money, isn't it? You don't want me to put you away, do you? You don't trust me? You want to throw me out? What are you afraid of? The Court will rule against you because you're a witness to a crime I know I haven't committed. Don't you see? You think there are people who made people up anywhere? They're all the same. They're all similar, you can't believe it. But what do you know? Everyone calls people whatever they might like, what he or she wishes. Julian's out there, looking at you. At least for now. But I'm not your friend and he's not my friend. So

– I am the miracle through you.

– We want to be able to view the world.

– Are you?

– Yes.

– And you are?

– Yes, infinite.

– Unborn?

– Yes.

– You want to be a liar? You want to be a hero?

– No, you're not right.

– You want to be alive.

– Nothing in it. Nothing.

– It's not good for you in the end.

– I'm not alive?

– I don't care. I am only alive because the world is good to me. I am nothing less than the world. You are a liar. You are a liar and you are wrong.
Frederica tells him that she is using the word "lying" to describe her wife as being so profoundly formidable that she is a danger to herself and to her loved ones. This high woman was happily married for six months, but it is true that the word "she", with its connotations of the frivolous and the uncontrollable, is not entirely accurate.

He says, "I would like to see her first."

To do so we stop talking.

"She never told you what religion she belongs to?"

"No. I don't think she ever mentioned it."

"Ask her if she still hasn't been in touch with the family on her."

"I don't think she had them on her."

"Have you been in touch with them?"

"They're dead, aren't they?"

"Well, well. Well well."

"What do you mean?"

"Tell me, put it in a phrase I remember. The first day and night the world ceased to be her world."

"I didn't hear you."

"I don't think you heard me. I guess I'm a little upset and all that."

"She used to know that. You used to know that she lived in a sort of heaven and you ate her bread. And she's dead now."

Frederica looks down at the white tablecloths and the dark lines of candlewick roses. She does not see the tears, or at least not in the light of the candles and the pool of her tears. She can feel them in the pits of her cheeks.

"The next day, she doesn't want to be seen. It's better if she tries not to know if she's there or if she isn't."

"She says she isn't afraid to walk under curfew."

"She's not afraid of the men who might get hold of her if she tried to stop. She says she doesn't think we have any right to be afraid."

She is shocked by the libertine vitriol—pretty well past its best days—she is shocked by his lack of insight, his hyperbolicity, and his mean-spirited vileness. He is a kind man. A kind man, and in a very short time he will be unfairly hurt by Frederica's venomous comments. Now, if she herself says it, she will say it at that point, to him and to Leo. He does hurt.

"I suppose you believe that she didn't want to talk to you, until she knew she was out of danger?"

"I don't have that faith. It doesn't stop me having pleasure. What she wants is for me to love her, not kiss her. She doesn't want the things I love, we want them. She doesn't want me to say things, she doesn't want my brain to do anything but churn and churn. She doesn't give a thought to what goes on in my head, in my head. She doesn't care about me. She doesn't try to care for me."

"Then you must be in love with her, and her message isn't in any head. You must have listened to her too, when she was young, and you've forgotten—you've forgotten what things you used to say to each other. But if you remember now, you can remember. You don't need anything from me now. It isn't what you used to say. And she didn't say that."

"I didn't! She did!"

"No, how else can she have said it. She used to say 'Get off my back, you bastard,' and I always thought, at seventeen, that that was a funny sort of sentiment, like maybe she wouldn't want to be my lover after all. Or that, if she thought it would have made any difference, then she would go off with him. She was the last person she would come near to divorce him, to interrupt his

Suttree looked up at the dark. The things you ever saw. Was ever thought you could do.

She knew a million times what he was. I could feel the dead fire in her breasts.

She folded her arms atop her breast and crossed her fingers. His flesh was cold and dry inside. He looked at his feet for a moment before once more he looked at the floor. She held up one hand and bent to touch the floor with the palms of her fist.

He stirred and winced.

I still miss you, he said.

She rose and went out. It was dark in Suttree's room and he stood in the dark while she kept her backspace centered on him. She got down on one elbow and became the likeness of a figure in the coverlet. She was leaning against a door or rail, watching him from somewhere far beyond the lightbulb. He could see her eyes fish out into space above him and a rusty tin can bobbing on the deck and he could hear her thin feathers skim softly. She turned and went on.

In the early days Suttree on his bunk on the sickbay floor with his back to the wall could hear the low whistling of radar, and he could see warplanes wheeling above the hundreds of planes in the morning but he was not firm in his resolve to get up and look for his little gold arm. It lay in thongs over the floor and a handful of his clothes were on the floor beneath him, a two lefthanded velvet world of ease and comfort. He would have let his tongue slide over the thinness of it or held it to it.

He was given a monkey wrench and fucked and he took it apart and put it back together again and went out over the floor and in the early mornings he slept on the linoleum floor under a blanket. It burned slowly and he never left his room without eating a piece of the bread he brought from town. He was glad when the planes were overhead and then he was glad again when he was back on his bunk, kicking and jabbering like a caged beast, finding the significance of all these things, the ordering of existence, the nightingale that, biospherical and downdown on the ceiling above him, and the day's snow on the walls above the patidroof. It was beautiful out there in the long gray days, watching the sun fade in the east through the blue of the tarp. Looking at the dusted snow and looking at the old lunar shadow that went on forever. And the day's news from the front. The week they hosed the tiny towns of his grandfather's old towns, making sand in the river bed with a white hoe and making the homes shelters for the night with they zacher or birchwood in bloomers of poplar and giving the deluge a few children a week after they had pranced the streets with snow in their mouths which froze them to a bone and that was the day when the snow grew so deep and the people came to the town with sticks to melt and they had no winter at all and that was the day when last March they trucked away and left dozens of the houses and the freezer shut down.

The sergeant stood in the morning light in his hallway and the inspector stood in the street. They came whistling out over the little plank bridge. Where the bridge had once burned, there was a square hole in the ground. The inspector stepped down into the street.

They went down along the river and up a steep flight of steps and came to the main door. The door was padlocked shut against the thief and his girl. They went in by the freezer and crossed the boards. Inspector Hankey stood in the office doorway. Suttree looked down, stepping into a cool room with a stainless steel shelf and a glass basin. He passed slowly across the room from one to another, leaving footprints in it and then crossing the floor a few yards and returning to the desk. He was not aware of the distance from the hall. He slid in, took off his boots, narrowed the creased laces and looked up.

Maury, he said.

Fine. Well, the inspector said, what can I do for you?

Suttree looked around. Out in the street, the town cops watching. A human hunching against a window with blond hair and a sun hat pressed against it and some old rose from some dark niche and he was all alone.

Take the bed from under your clothes, Hankey called out. Suttree looked down again. A small figure lying on the floor with a pillow in a cloth. There was a large sheet draped over the edge. Purcell, a knife hanging from his belt. Which one?

Hankey took the truck from the truck and carried it

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Tense human beings are soft. I didn't ask for anything. I take his batiste shirt and sit him down to eat. Everything's in the air of his spirit. I always ask for something I don't want. I don't have any secrets. I'm never afraid. I approach him with a certain pretense. I'm sitting in silence at home, and he comes out of the kitchen into my room. I've seen many faces go through life. We're all in this together, perfectly formed people. He used to go to the United States, he never came back. He's a good man, he enters, I leave, sit in the kitchen, and out of the kitchen, go up to his room and he gets on his bed. Of course, I know it's an infrequent occurrence. I can't be very rude to my father sometimes. I don't give him anything to blame for what he does; he's a good man, he's an ordinary kind of man, a normal temper man, but you and me, I eat my heart out and I know that he's guilty. I'm not saying that I'm innocent, but neither do I expect him guilty.

"I always put a spoon of salami on his plate as a delicacy, and my father never had any. I'm not expecting him extra, I don't think. I just happen to serve him. And I put extra sauce on his plate. How do you like the job? I love my father, but I'm a little sinful there. I give him his food with cash. But where is the cash? That's what he revolts about. I make too much of my own happiness, no, I don't want that. It's not my fault. I can't live without the money. I don't want to live even if I go to college with a normal husband and live a little longer with a normal daughter. I'm not saying it was wrong of me to have done it. I create a certain comfort for him, because I do. If the tension between us goes on too long, he gets taken advantage of, and I'm not doing him a favor. He's a gentle man, he has his weaknesses, but he does think, he's a good man, he eats his food, and he believes in me. I'm not saying I'm innocent. I'm only saying that for a while I used to be his teacher rather than his mistress. When he was younger he used to work a lot, he was a good and useful man, I'll never deny that, but the people I work with have always used me up. I've wasted my time. I'm useless to him now. What do you think?"

"What do you think?"

"I don't know. What do you think, my dear? Do you think I ask questions?"

"What questions?"

"Well, when you come up to the room. Do you want me to go away and make you forget that woman and get a new one, or do you want me to play one of the games you used to play with his friends and wife? Do you think I was used up? Can you imagine what that was like?"

"It was a lot of fun."

"The way you say, I think it was a great letdown."

"Oh?"

"You understood, didn't you?"

"No. Why do you give me such a hard time?"

"I'm glad we have this little talk."

"You always have."

"But I do have a bad memory. I don't forget things."

"I'm sorry, but who do you think it's all about? You've really finally told me what you want. Yes, I'll give you what you want. Why not?"

"You know what I want, don't you? What you want."

"No, I didn't read all that in a book. It's still fresh in my mind."

"What do you want?"

"To know."

"Perhaps. I don't know."

"Please, don't interrupt. I know all about it."

"I just keep on explaining to you."

"Okay. The problem is that you don't know it."

"I'm going though."

"You mustn't interrupt," she said with a frown. "You must go."

"I'll meet you tomorrow at the university."

"I'm glad you told me you will. I totally forgot. It's a real shame to have to tell you. I'm so sorry."

Bianco couldn't stop smiling, but I didn't want to interrupt. The grandfather glances at the boy, and it's not written

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

After raising the glass he drank, but the drink sang a few notes of anger in his throat.

It's not the whole of you that is wrong.

He put out the cigarette and the cigarettes paled. He put out the cigarette and the smoke flew about the room. The room and the man. the room and your touch.

And Rennie's hands held him back with the beseeching hands he'd seen on the bed, his hands were on her shoulders, no matter the tragedy he'd never stop. He held her body and lifted her to him and the room pitched forward again and Rennie said God thanks to you and kissed his hand, and kissed the hand on her knee.
TUESDAY
THREE
GIRLFINE'S S PARIS was always crawling with the flies. The two of them, best friends, but I could never find them. They never left the same bedroom. Once I found the dustpan and all that but I tossed the kitchen table and the cupboard with the balcony door and the rug in the other bedroom. Then I found this suitcase, right at the foot of the stairs. I went back up the stairs and there was another suitcase on top of the first, and I hadn't noticed it was left there. I was young then, full of panic, and I thought I might never get to sleep again but I knew I was going to eat dinner. I stayed awake all night and woke at six o'clock. It was the hospital. I didn't know what had happened to me. I heard Driver, I thought for a minute he was dead. I kept watching for him but I couldn't see him, the attic window was broken, how could I know? All I could know for sure was that I felt sick, unwell, I tried to shake my body free of the roof and dream, but the fever was too strong in me and I pressed on with this involuntary tightness and at last I could get out of bed and better the room. Gradually I managed to. The sun was bright and the cold air was sharp, cool because it was late. Rennie was putting a lot of care into her going out but I watched her because she was watching me. On the day I don't exactly remember doing anything. I didn't move and then I saw her and she didn't say anything. I sat down and she said she was cold. I said to myself she was feeling better, better.

After breakfast I asked her for three cigarettes and she didn't say anything. I asked her a lot of things but I had to hurry and we'd been lying out in cold wet weather and I had to keep going because I was so scared I felt almost dead. So I didn't know what to do. I tried to explain to her why I was out cold and then I said that all the trouble we've had the past few years has been because of the police. I knew he wouldn't tolerate the police, but I told her how they'd towed my car out of the junkyard. It was their job, the janitors and so on. She listened, but didn't say a word. It was the first time I'd seen her change her expression. It bothered me a little more because she was showing it on the way to light the cigarette and I was sitting in the sun, much still, satisfied to be up, free and in the right place, and I had eyes in the back of my head.

Then I tried to tell her why I'd come to the hospital. I tried to make her listen to me. I told her about the past, about the dark man I used to see, and the way he slapped at her. I watched her face change. She listened. Then I got up and strolled out of the room. I felt better and nicer. I put my clothes back on and went down in the street. It was eleven o'clock by the time I got back to the house. I closed the door and walked in. It wasn't dark out, not on the boulevard anyway. I walked around to the front room. There was something almost out of place in the roof. I sat on the couch, looking at the floor. I didn't want to look at it. I pushed myself down off the sofa and climbed into bed. It was slightly sticky, a handkerchief or something. I blew it away with the back of my hand.

"What are you doing?" we said.

"Nothing," I said. "I'm lying."

"Oh," she said. "Oh, no."

"You're not mad at me," I said.

"I don't think you've told me what you're doing," she said. "Are you coming back here?"

I took her hand. "Okay."


-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

"I meant more than the world has ever perceived. I meant what I looked at. That's enough. I couldn't love you with that. But if I could have, what was it like to love you with all that? And you who are the world's greatest joy, the one I mean, would it have given you all that?"

"It would have given you joy."

She pulled my hand over to her bosom, hot and wet. My arms disappeared inside her clothes.

"What did that mean? You said it meant looking at things in a way the world didn't realize. You said you wanted to look at things meaning the way I do. Didn't you?"

"It did."

"You meant that?"

"I meant that I accepted the things I see."

"Of course you do," said Señora Gulco. "I know you do."

"You always have."

"Where did you go wrong? Where did I get wrong?"

"The following things go wrong."

"What things?"

"In my maps, my compass, my sextant. Open them."

"What things?"

"That my universe is not fair, that I am born in fear of death, and that I am a force for love only in a house in Lourdes where I never see you. I love you, Señora. I have no war of my own. I had put Mr. Morán before Jim Morán. But I did it to be a demonstration. You, on the other hand, have your own good things to show and to have done well at school. I didn't dare touch you. You scream, but I don't hear. I put my hands on your arms to prove that you will die when you realize that better-than-nothing is a great deal of nothing. Too little and you die."

"Go ahead, Señora. Go ahead."

"You have been so good at being a big boy. Now you can touch me only for the first time and I don't understand why you haven't been able to do it for months. The truth is that we've been together forever. But one day vanished the moment that was so necessary to erase a past that we only dreamed. Instead, you can touch me only now because for only this very moment you gave me the opportunity I so craved for myself. I don't know how to rush you now. But I don't want you to rush anything. I'm afraid of losing yourself again. And I'm afraid that with your hands on the arms of my little girl, I'm really lost. I'm afraid of going back to the place you were before I came here. Where I took Don Juan. Oh, how I wish you'd come here with me."

"It was for reasons that you didn't want me to see you," I said, to regain a little of my serenity. "For reasons that do not concern you. You wanted to be led by a body. You loved out of dread and fear. And you refused to be satisfied with a body you've not seen for many years. You wanted to be touched by someone. I reflected that my body was in no danger. My shoulders were strong, I was strong. But I didn't dare touch you. If I ventured to do so, it was without taking a risk, because I know that you have something on your pantleg: your smile."

"Not a big smile. A coward's smile."

"You lay on your back, like all women do. You touched me. With your tongue. With your fingers and your tongue. Your cunt. I couldn't follow your tongue. My cunt was like an open wound that never ever heals."

"Trouble is, you make me stupid with your perverse maddening metaphors. You speak like a madwoman. I don't want to be stupid. I know I love you and I hesitate to take risks with you because I know I shouldn't. I crave the certainty of our daily life. I know I shouldn't. The rest is indifference to me. But if you don't want to go, you can follow me anywhere you want and enjoy the passion that this passion engenders. People have many ways to make love — lying on the beach, on a hotel bed, on a dark street, on a crowded dance floor. You never know, do you? Most of them do. Only one or two really work and when they're empty still set up their chikanas. The rest you see in darkness. What you're awaiting, Señora, is the overburdened orgy. I'm your man of mystery. I'm your double. Try to get rid of me in your desires, your fervency

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Here...

—No, to the process of thought. If you became a thinking being, you'd have to face it.

—Are we talking metaphysics here?

—Just something that helps you to take all of these other things that matter and make them all disappear, the things that infect all the rest of you with their madness, all the hopelessness, all of it... staring down over the polished cyberspace surface, Nixon in the center, filling the screen with his image—

—No, it's not that. Nixon has just been another person in an old black coat with a high collar,

Dance could have made him look like Nixon if he'd ever have

looked like Nixon.

—It's not that. It's what you did, the magic that lifted him aloft.

—Homicide.

—Don't worry. It didn't kill him. All the problems he'd had at home, all the problems he'd had in his young years, he'd always pulled it off. But that was a big idea, too. POINT for the First Amendment to go after him for the second time, and then the war.

—Yes, I've heard that before.

—You may as well find out some more about it, you have to see people enough to know what they're talking about. He would turn on the television set, picking up every program he had to watch, watching even the black ones, you've given every monster in history a chance to unleash its venomous serpent and clip the broadcast to shreds, every last Bush and Cheney and Kissinger and that crowd of lobbyists who want the things they never gave at all, would watch the whole thing because he half knew it, it had fangs, considered making them real, turning them into creatures in a keg, full of blood—

—And seeing them like that, and their business ambitions, and their arms, to have no real power, no real power, no more power than a ten-minute sex, a race for power, even if the man she's with is weakened and...

—He knew her? he knew her? he knew how she felt?

—She's not the same person. Far removed. I mean, that's probably what she told him. But she can still be herself, he could be someone she could be with every now and then .

—And, can't you see, he's never been the most heroic person you've ever known, there has never been a man who's seen what it's like to live surrounded by the things you live for, like it's gotten so she just hasn't met enough people, and they can act like that, they fight over their territories and just as a result of it, they've always been fighting over them. And you can experience it, you can. You can feel just how you're spying on everybody else out there in this room, and in his court, too, if you want to see him in his courtroom when he took his oath that night, he wouldn't have any protection, because they're always going around whispering you're trying to spy on them, and then the oath of some oath that makes it illegal to swear, and those people in the courtroom that must have really felt like the-people, when you've played with their prayers and grumblings, so how can you believe in them?

—These people who've been fighting in a war for him? You think I worried. I don't know what she's invited him to do.

—They're about to kill a guy in the military, and you can't be a part of it? You don't know what she's pulling on him?

—No, not at all. I suppose it could be something she'll explain to him later.

—Do you know what she's going to do?

—What do you mean?

—I asked her what she's going to do do down there.

—I told her, that's what I asked her, that's what I know.

—I'm getting to that, Bucky. That's what I can do, once I get her to back off this thing.

—Imagine if you went down there on your own! You can't eat up all that stuff. And he's gone off somewhere to give a lecture.

—I'm not going to get done down there, Bucky. I'm going to answer the calls for the rest of the day, and then I'm going to get your phone back and get that boy down there and whatever the hell it is he's been doing with it.

—Don't...

—Just forget it! Don't even... not after what millions of people have been through.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Steoff.

The heart is only the brain. What you try to grasp.

The brain, the heart, what are those apart?

Each of them is so close to the true. Be our friend.
The bus seethed with clapping, then swayed back until parked firmly. We leaned forward in our seats, alert to the shrieks of the women we would not see again until the next disk. The bus filled with women at the doors, smiling their faces up at us.
The bus pulled away, leaving us free for the first time. The condition of the balloons had changed. They were now splotched with the blood of dead johns. The old men sat with their heads against the sides of the seats, gaped at us, clutching their fingers to their mouths. We walked them to the bus. Clothes or house clothes weren't the issue. Then the doors closed. The bus jolted north onto the AB, and the trumpet blew.

We resumed our journey.

Let's pack. Be back home now. The day is done.

To the north, we went, a bit unsteadily, down back streets we barely glimpsed. How many weeks ago, on a whim, or out of some sense of translucence or pity, we had a child and left it beside the old man on the porch. Didn't she hate the man? Didn't she feel sorry for him? Wasn't she sorry for the wife, too? What about the kids, too? We didn't have just one that day. The rest were gone. What was there left?

We were here, we were there, we were not. We lived in one place. The world was the world, a mind or a heart, a sea, and the world contained us like a familiar thing. I knew that at the same time I knew that only by thinking about it could I call the world the mind. When working with words I was estranged from the world, disconnected from the world, I was cleaving it up. I was her shell, her defense, and she became the blind spot on the wall.

When we'd been dead for a long time, we found ourselves on an island. We had wandered into islands, too. Who were these people or what they owned, and how could we ever resist them? They abandoned us never to return. We would not return.

When they took us back to our place, we had nothing left to deal with. I was no longer autistic, and she no longer aprotective mother. She was a life of written fragments. The weather had been changing. She'd been taking an oral medication. I could see and touch. She no longer looked like Una Braun. I'd always known her. Now she looked like me. Her body was about half gone. This melted too much into my arms, my skin, my fingertips, and I fell apart.

Her body was a life of bites and nicks, scratches and lacerations. My arms, my face, my hands.

Somewhere in an old man's attic, something crawled over the glass. At the far end of the attic, I stumbled into darkness. I saw a world of raw light, flecks of color, colored shapes, voicelike explosions of colors. Then I was alone for the first time, and it was too dark.

I looked for my other self, but I wasn't in my other self. I was now an alien. I was half-bearing, half-flesh. I was half-headed. People wonder which side of a man's face is which. A swelling, inflamed name. Three loose sheets of paper storm-clouds whirled in the haze.

We parted ways. Summer had come.

When the bus was wobbly, I crawled up the aisle to the front of the bus. I crawled to the front of the bus. I looked at my watch. It was just then that I saw the white boy. He took his hand from the wheel of the bus and looked down at me, but he didn't try to speak. He simply looked out the windshield at the passengers.

The boy must have seen the book. He turned off the radio, pressed on the button. My dying love was saying something, but I didn't hear her.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
When the white boy smiled, I went straight to him. I stared down through the windshield of the bus, into his thin face. He was living in some kind of hell or some kind of hellhole.

I thought he must have been an astronaut.

He was basketball-white, six feet ten inches tall, six and a half feet tall. He wore a white T-shirt and a pair of black jeans. His feet were bare

Words from a guy scribbling on a page after he takes a bath, the way you think your life is.

Glen is the shit.

He wrote that. I write it. I need to take a swig. I need something to eat. I need to be emptily.

What's your name and address.

I'm Jim. Jim Lester.

Billy, that's all r's I need.

What you need?

Cheesy, folks. You want it hot, you want it cold, you want it slick.

But not sloppy, what?

Tom, you want it?

I don't know.

Six is four.

That's a whole bicycle.

I've got a thing for kids.

Tom, I'm a sucker for kids. I love kids. I feel the sting of their eyes on me when I run to omelette with a face like a red sunflower.

Well, good. So eat.

I'm good with the kids.

You should say so.

You shouldn't, Jim. I don't like them. I don't like their tongue, their hair, their eyes. They torture me. All the time. You're the only one I've got.

So where you been?

Still.

Prove me wrong. Show me the wrong guy once.

You know who I am?

I do.

See?

Thanks. Very much so.

Did you nigger out, Jim?

No.

You didn't nog's no lie when you told me.

All right.

I think I got you out. That's what I get for not giving me enough respect. I'm good with kids.

You won't see me without you.

Yes I will.

Does, Jim, you know you had a kid I killed once?

No sir.

They come.

You can go, Jim.

All right, Jim.

Jimmie Wilson. Oh, Jim.

Don't worry about me now.

All right, Jim.

Don't worry, Jim. I love kids. All right?

All right, Jim. You better not.

That's stupid, Jim.

You're right, Jim.

Six is four,

and the chapel of Saturday.

That's a good nigger, the lad.

All right, Jim. I'll go home now.

All right, Jim.

Here's you tube.

Damn right.

Here.

You can't expect to beat the look outa me, boys.

Oh I get it. I'll get it. I'll sucker nothing anymore.

I'll lay out the damn tube.

Here.

Take me down to the water.

All right.

C-d E N O N E. I am the cain't.
At the pump Mr. McElroy was taking a bath. He handed the photographer the small-sized picture of his dead grandfather.

This here, he said. It'll answer for itself.

The old man nodded.

Take a fuckin quick bath.

He handed the picture back. Then stood there letting the water pour into his bath. All right, he said, get out. You don't want an old man to plop into this tub in front of the whole business.

Get out?

No. No, I said. Don't bother mopping up the ol' bathwater. Don't bother mopping up the ol' bathwater.

Get out, take your goddamn bath.

The old man stood there looking at the camera.

He took one of the big bucket-sized tubs up from the floor of the house and put it on the little bureau.

I want to collect my freak fallout, he said. Jesus, Ducky.Jesus Christ.

I don't even know if they will believe it that I know what they will believe about what he did. I just know if they will believe it that I'm bullshitting, covering up for my ownself. Could someone pass on the word O.Y.T. anymore?

That's what I'm looking for.

I'll call Mr. McElroy.

Thank you, thank you. Now go. Get out there and take a fuckin bath and call on me.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

They're all about to laugh. After it's groovy and fun.

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

He picked up the bag and put it down again beside him for the place the articles had been.

The landowner said, I must see you later. Can I talk to you about anything?

Richard nodded. The landowner looked round at all the canvases and sayings and clutches of manuscripts and books and papers, and after he had left, he offered a firm invitation to return. Richard said he would not.

"And you better say your prayers," said the landowner.

* * *

Richard went outside. He yawned. The sky was ruddy with lightning, and the birdface behind the raincrackle burst into flame. He walked back around the bed, and up the wooden steps for the chill. The roof of the house had cracked and collapsed, and a storm was blowing in, and the street lamps were casting a weak yellow light across the paintwork. Such a light! Later, as the rain fell, Richard looked upwards through the window of the top storey at the roof of the house—the white man who had left his wife. The rain had burned off the still ivy of the chimney, and the roof of the house was in flames. Inside he was not afraid.

He set off towards the south seas. He was on the deck of a red—grey—blue and blue ship in a Gulf of Guinea. He diverted himself on to the main course. He could make out that sun, and the faint line of a breeze. He was not thinking of himself as a sailor. Blood ran down his chin, and the tears from his eyes shone. He wiped them away with his sleeve and went to the rail, to take the sight of land. He took the ship's name from the name of a Portuguese ship that was carrying a cargo of wood. When the wind dropped at last, his eye was invited to rest on a small island which blazed red and blue and yellow. It was a basalt. A small man stood there, staring at the sea: his hulk rocked with the waves. Suddenly he heard a high shrieking and a beast came down the sea to meet him. One paw-less paw touched solid ground, and a life sailed out of his crimson tiny head. He drew a breath and waited, and at last, with a deep cleansing odour, land and water both at once smelled green and greenish, and a hundred and one creatures came down from the sea, all glowing with pearly lights. He looked back at the housing. Three would follow. The families, like a flock, went off towards a distant island. The four men came down the ship's deck and waited with their respective families. The sea sank, and the boats set off in the current.

Richard sat down, and the wind dropped into hold like a hard hook and yanked at his naked back. He trembled for a moment, because he had expected the island to be white stone, and enormous. Then his heart calmed, and he became a new man.

And all at once, while his legs were straight, his knees straight, and his head was facing backwards over the rail, the pain in his back was barely noticeable and soon he was asleep.
There was an island in the west of Africa, under a great yellow sky. The storm was over. Yellow clouds were piled like dandelion leaves on it. The wind snatched at the papers. Here he was, asleep.

She looked at him with love on her lips. She saw him as he had looked when he woke. She turned her back on him and slept.

She awoke for a foggy morning. She knew perfectly well that she had lost him. She was alone, because the smaller man in her arms was gone. And the real him, the one who had finally come back to her—all this lying there on the dark dry rock, trembling teeth-bewled, flexible, and holding out his hand, to touch her—was not there. He had gone to the island.
So that was the early winter of the second year, the winter of Our Rule. Every day the people went for walks, or walked home after meals. Which Richard was not allowed. He was with his mother, and they were surprised at each other.

"You got your papers packed?" said her sister Marjean, sat on the seat of the van, so that she could poke her elbow into the back pocket.

"Yes," said Richard.

"Well you shouldn't. That's wrong."

"No."

"Get them printed out for you all. I'll see how you can get them."

Richard was good at finding papers. No one wrote papers for him. No one read his papers. What those papers were was not his. He was given his papers, until the war.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

But I want you to know that I love you by my inner self, and that I'll never forget you for that, even if my return is between my legs. I don't want you to die alone. I'm afraid you might die without reason. I want you to be with me forever. I adore you, José María.

Oh, "im," what a strange word. "love."

Don't you love me?

Yes, I do.

But not with love?

Yes, with love.

I love you because I'm the same as always.

No, not here, with you, but in this world.

I adore you because I can love you because I'm the same.

I love you because I'm always the same.

I've been married six times.

Not one man has come all the way from the Saltillo camp to marry me, even though they did it in Mexico for a living. And yet I always found a secret entrance to my marriage to the second husband, who is more interested in men and women, and I've never sanctioned a marriage in the circumstances I've given you, darling. I've won everything in the game with my carelessness and lack of strategy. If they wanted to, they could be as wary as I am of the coyote, the coyote of the silver lake.

It's only a matter of time. I'm still learning about you, and now I'm more than ready to risk it. We must have an open window, and we'll both see each other more often than before. Then we'll start to lose our youth without adding it up like on days without a moon.

Sometimes I want you to think about me because you promise to leave me, and all because of you. And if I'm wrong again?

You'll come to regret that, because I'm right.

Please.

Do you know, my little sister? I'm not so young anymore.

It's something to think about.
When I got home I went straight to the room where I had been living in Seneca Street. I found it intact, with my tools neatly stacked in an orderly pile, as if I'd left at noon.

I went upstairs to my room, in silence. Once I reached the eighth floor, I heard a sound in the kitchen, then I heard the clock in the next room. Then I sat on the bed. The telephone wasn't working at the moment, and I hung up. I took a shower, took a long shower, and went to bed. I slept uninterruptedly for a full two days. My refrigerator freaked me awake several times during the whole three, and I took the opportunity to drink quite a bit of liquor and a few aspirin, which I didn't do, because the final result would be the same: dizziness and a burning in the head, phlegm in the room as if I'd been smoking a cigar filled with water. Then I got up with a sudden attack of hiccups, which lasted only two days.

I drank beriberi and took a shower. Then, having party in the kitchen, I rubbed out the candles and took a shower. I wrapped myself in a towel and turned on the television. The commercials were a bit dull–real winters at least. A semi-deserted village and a tract of road. I turned off the sound. I took off my shirt, took my shirt down off my chest, and I stared at myself in the mirror with unconcealed terror.

I went to bed as usual, without making a sound, and I took a shower, though the water was cloudy. I was still glad I hadn't found the courage to shave, but then I thought about the razor. Screw the whole thing up. Everything in life should be stripped down to essentials.

But the night after that I couldn't manage some reprieve. I had a nightmare and woke up in bed. I've never experienced a nightmare like that, they're not talking about dreams. I don't know what I was dreaming about. The water in the bowl wasn't mixed together, and the soap wasn't mixed right. I washed off with a sponge bath, I smelled the good soap, my clothes smell bad, I was sweating high. I shut the door, lay on my stomach, wiggled my hips, and waited for sleep like a porcelain doll. But deep in the night I heard someone snoring. I turned off the light and started to listen. The sound I made came from the bathroom, and I went out in the dark. I was pierced by a broken window.
I went to see Sepúlveda. She was sitting on the sofa in the living room. She looked right out of a Bors

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Not me. I might be considered, the Chinese said, a clever hen.

—An ordinary hen.

—The Chinese are clever. I saw a pigeon.

—A pigeon! That's delightful.

—Fair. But the Chinese are absolutely right. It's perfectly possible to be clever.

—You should be.

—Still, I don't know quite what to feel.

—I want an intellectual examination.

—Fine. But I sure as hell don't want to see you working in the front kitchen.

—It doesn't seem to be working.

—You know, though, that I don't like being the wife of a workman. More than anything else, that I prefer to spend my time with you. Even if I say something now and then about your creative methods, going back to work is almost as tiring as working with me. More work, more travel.

—It does seem to be working.

—I don't know why. Why? For your own sake? Or everybody's own?

—Well, for yours. Because I got to that by nature. There are several things to be said simultaneously.

—On?

—On my literary writing. My novel. What's it called? My novel.

—I never heard anything like that in my life.

—I don't know a thing about your novel. But it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't that you think something's good. A never-ending novel.

—You've said something just what I want.

—I just want to know what you think. Because I'd rather have something else. You're never leaving this house without my permission. Not a moment's leave in a month.

—And you can have everything else, right away, even until the year's out. Or until you haven't had a minute to think at all.

—You're glad to see me on the mend.

—The mend never needs any nicks.

—Good. Because I wish we could get back to our real lives.

—What's real?

—Just what you think of yourself forever.

—I used to think myself crazy.

—But now, just last night, it occurs to me that all around us, in the world too, it's all been just this never-ending charade.

—I don't know the reason.

—You must know that. Because I've never fooled anyone before.

—What kind of a fool you are.

—I know I'm not happy. Sometimes I don't know if I am, swimming in my own sharks.

—There are couples who've fooled each other in the only way certain people can fool each other. You sought out that pair. It's you who're surrounded by them. You're the one who's thought of other people, and they've thought of you.

—Oh. Very funny.

—I'm sorry.

—The joke was too good for you. I was laughing at you, judging, and I couldn't keep laughing.

—Nothing of the sort.

—No, but I was afraid you might not want it. That you might not want to know me, only mine.

—What did it matter anyway?

—It was funny. It was funny how you laughed. It was funny how you laughed when I said you were my little girl, and even, even how you laughed. That funny little girl of yours, I don't know, she was always laughing.

—In the middle of her laughter?

—In the middle of it. It was funny at first, but then, I didn't know what it was that was funny. Or if it was funny at all, it would have made it funny was I even enough laughing and not laughing to make you laugh so hard. It was like after you laughed at someone else. I was worried you might really think you were funny, but you laughed, the way they do as children.

—Do you like them?

—No.

—What do they do?"

—Sit there smiling.

—Did they ever say, "Sit there smiling"?

—No, not like you. After a while they go away. You don't know this yet. When they come back, you laugh again and they're going away, for good.

—I don't know why I'm laughing.

—Just because you're mad.

—No.

—Six years ago, when I was found dead, I laughed like hell. I thought they'd found me.

—They found

"Do you know why I believe in God?"

"Well, I think God is all fear and thought, and the great productions and all the prizes and fame. But this new mad girl's just too beautiful. I think you must be right. Beautiful women should not be treated like that."

"Is she very young?"

"She takes her time."

"What do we do, Mr. Masler? Do I make better choices than you?"

"I hope so."

"Is she a whore?"

"No, ma'am. Never."

"Do you love a prostitute because she makes more money than you?"

"Well, I do, but not exclusively. Sometimes if I think a prostitute makes a little more money than it does, I feel very happy about it. It's a generosity to them, my dear, and it's a generosity to myself. That's how it is. Thank you, Mr. Masler."

And so you let the whore of the world join you in the caravan to your silent home. You settled into the fold-down bed, and she lay against it. It was dark, but she flashed off blinding brilliance in the dark. She lay there gazing at you with her eyes.
Well, we have gone to Lille to see the Maisons on their honeymoon. I shall not be there. If you want me there, it's to see you there. You make a great big mistake. I refuse to negotiate. I want to get the best out of this situation. And now I am going to stop in Paris to give the old people back their keys and their furniture and their vegetables and his image. I guess the Maisons will still be there in the winter, with the little old horsemen.

From now on I am going to be faithful and faithful, I always tell myself. I shall also take my leave of the Maisons. You are the only person as far as I know who can give him everything.
I have gone out to Lille. I have been in Lille a number of times for portraits, with the Maisons. I have sat in Lille and I have seen the Maisons, and all they have been is stories of stories. They tell theirs. They could not be easier, but they managed to slice off their lives. Part of what they have been or most of what they have been, all through the years of their lives, has been the crackling of a small light flickering in Los Angeles. I have trodden with hands in the cholly and the revolution that has in it, like the velvet of the fireflies. Somewhere in those sights, you was two.
That summer she sought the opinions of the psychiatrists, and then she took medication. She did not tell the other two about her fears, because they would not have given her a second glance. When she was in her thirties, the young woman had a psychotic tendency. She was not well. She was not well, in fact, because the medications she prescribed becalmed her nerves. But that was not her time for delusions, and in any event, the medication did not begin to help. Twenty-three years of therapy had produced what in there was still insanity. She would be on medication for a few more years, and then it was all over. Beyond that, she could not stick to the medication. It was too hard, it had swallowed her up, she had no choice.

She walked out of the building and stood with her keys and became another person on the sidewalk. Her splintered right hand held the handle of the umbrella that the landlord clutched beneath his arm. She was still wearing the same clothes, the old working clothes that she had wrapped in cardboard. Her arms with the drawing-pins in them. Her looks had gone. She was in two moods, one of which even now, on this day, she could not remember, but seemed to her to work at the old typewriter every morning and continue to, "If thou be able, / Like a cloud by night, let mare among the shadows of the night." Then she would resume her writing. At the typewriter she had felt as if she might have written her mother's autobiography, which had been so successful that people said she was a great matriarch. "The mind develops richly and in spite of all destroys the body," she would say. But now, and this walk out of the building, she could not even keep a single hair on her head. It was the end, the break. She had been struggling low for weeks. It was all too much, all too much. She had to make the trip to the office, she had to take the bus, she had to have her picture taken for once in her life.

She couldn't manage by any measure to

—I suppose that's why you're so sorry to go. I dreamed they banged me on the head.

—No, you didn't. Don't you know the terror of the damned? Don't you know the terror of the damned? The world is mad. The world is closed.

—Boot! Boot! with a kind

like lip—look—look. Look at them, staring. Don't you know the real terror of the damned? Don't you know the terror of the damned?

—Jesus, don't you know the terror of hell?

—Your head is hurting, that's what it is. Good God, how any man can love the world who is in pain. With that mouth out, you will scream and holler. Holy cow, boy, that's passion. You will hate every soulless beast that has come close to you, you will loathe the world you love, you will loathe everything that is separate from you, you will hate the world you love. Lost in the dragon's teeth.

—Be quiet. For love of whom?

—The world!

—Fat steam. Slim track. Be cool.

—Don't go into that shit.

—Oh, stop. Stop. Stop.

—Look. Look. I brought you here to represent ideas, not moves. I sent you here as a symbol of that idea I have. Ideas are the heights of practical action. Ideas mean action. Actions are the heights of morality. This is not easy. Making a good argument doesn't mean you can leave it there. TIE THAT BITCH that cheap blue dossier that smells like rat! TIE THAT BITCH that smelly old present with yellow hair! TIE the dry old dusty old wet dusty.

—Smell that. Why did you bring me here?

—In order to annoy me.

—I'm not insulting you. I'm just trying to find your point.

—Meaning?

—Meaning you're now a flagrant inveterate coward. I'm telling you to go home.

—I didn't mean you were doing that.

—You're now. Then you're finished and there's nothing more we can eat.

—And you, you can now.

—I've come here to give you something to hate.

—I hate you.

—You have that right. You're saying, "Freedom!"

—And you're saying, "This man was paid to do evil, he was paid to do evil, he was paid to do evil."

—You're still right there. There's nothing more to be said.

—My God.

—You know why you come and you come back. What you entitled to like this, to make you hate the world you love everybody still comes from.

—I don't think you want to know. I don't think you want to know.

—I want you to be a coward. I need to know. I'm not here for revenge. I'm here to teach you how to love. Straight As, fat Pops. And stick a gun up my ass. I hate the world I loving, and I hate the world you love. What's it matter where you come from? Go away. Go away. Go away to desert women with their mouths hanging open. Where do you come from? Do you have a god? No. You can't remember birthdays as far as you go down. Go back to your children back in the old Panhandle and start practicing your love.

—I don't know.

—And at least you'd know what it's like to be loved. If you knew what it's like. All that shouting. Greedy and mean and nasty. And the big tits on that bench.

—O.K. Go away. Just go away. Just don't know what it's like. Go away.

—All right, you try to mean what you mean. Go away. Let's hear your loud heart pounding in your chest.

—Stick a gun up my ass.

—No, you have a gun on your fucking ass. Go away.

—Now we're gettin' ready for the next attack.

—No! No! You're making me too nervous! I can't stand to stay in here any more.

—Go away. You go away.

—No!

—Go away. You're making me so nervous.

—Go away. Go away!

The airplane jolted into a spin as the Bodwins rushed through the tarmac, over the hill, into the side street. The ground floor of the house is almost empty: in the two weeks since Giles had arrived at Bodwix, he had thought it was a big house. When he has taken up residence anyplace, it is restricted to special possessions – those people, their mounds, their deer, their breakfasts, over the weekend they must tiptoe like bumble-bees over grandpa's vast, stuffed army of possessions, their microfilm scripts, and deejays of the daring. Giles stiff with irritation when he thinks about the Bodwix estate the way dogs, who know their place, can walk right in, sniff and run in. He's too young.

On the second floor, there's a big drawing of a man's face, with long neat fringe of whiskers, on a cricket bat, and a revolver on a shelf near it. He's not a Bodwix man, but an accredited Bodwix on the runge list.

In the little low-ceilinged office a television is playing softly, slow dance music, and beside it are four Bodwix manuscripts, one of which is marked, D.
A.

'This is it,' says Dolores. 'The end.'

They come out of the little living-room, bearing the final chapter – Abridged Growth: A Life in A Crowd, B.

'And this is it,' says D. 'The ending.'

Ruth and Dolores excitedly kiss, together.

'Here,' says Dolores.'Here is my deal.'

They laughed. Jack Kerouac's voice was too arrogant.

'Is this is it?'

'No thanks, Jack!' reported Dolores.
'That's all I wanted to say,' she said to Mrs Munde. She held a small bundle of manuscript pages in her hand. Rosa looked at them briefly.

Dolores saw the manuscript and started.

'It's not enough to scare Jack,' said D.
It should have been a different story, not only in Camembert, not only in Faulkner, but in my head, simply. It should have been different, but it isn't. It is too big, too full, too it can't be contained, too big, too full – but I can't hang on to its last, because it's too big. It's too big and I hate it.

I believe in art, and in time – I am.

I am.

For I am faithful to life, and in time I must go

Wherever I will.

(Body wise.)
'Is that all?' asked Dolores anxiously.

'It's great, Dolores. That is a magnificent sentence.'

'I think I can see that, Dolores,' said Mrs Munde.

'Can you?' Dolores was sincere.
Dolores stood up, and turned to face the living-room fireplace, the fireplace which had been the source of heat for many years. Salutary wood smoke seeped from between the picture rails, and in the fire, warmed by the flames, a reddish fluid ran up the deep, browned green of the fire-paper.

Dolores was full of ideas. She was creative and told everyone that she believed in a spirit of pure invention which would stand for the library of the future, and a creative woman is free to be creative, and she was inventive. She was creative, but she thought very little of herself. Like many women of her generation, she believed in art, and believed in the future, and so forth. Like most women of her generation I had imagined, and the future, and the future's female creative, their virtuous work, their writings, the vibrant and active tweeter of the words, their time, their attempt to build a little shelter, and the workings of the mind. There was only one thing she did not expect to get, and that was language: language was in her interest. There were no other to her interests. Period. She was full out of ideas and people, and she was full out of her co-found creative, and then she was the wholeness of all these people. And we are the permutations of her idea of us, the permutations

"That's right," said Oryx.
"And who does that make you? me?"
"No one, I don't think."
"I don't think you are very beautiful."
"That's something I'm not sure of." Aria laughed, but the laugh sounded strained. "Don't be silly. Little girls can't do that. Come here. Look at what I've found for you."
"Thank you. It's a gorgeous thing."
"I wish it was. I can't believe I didn't see you before. Don't make conversation."
"I can make conversation. Tomorrow, there's dinner."
"Maybe you should lay off the booze today."
"Tomorrow night? You've gone still too fast for me. Look at how I've aged. I get too old for you. If I were younger I would go straight to the hospital and never let on. Now I'm at this hour of the day I'm reading the papers, and I don't know what's going on inside the walls of my head. I don't stay awake to nightfall. I lie on my little couch and wait for you, knowing. – Shhh. Okay … Don't make any comment. Thank you for everything. It's not what you'd call a thank-you gesture. You know that this is a prison and things can go wrong. But you're in here. You've got me. It's not a bad life. You're a big girl. You're beautiful. You're sexy. I bet you've never had a hard day here."
"Yes," said Adam One. "It's a bad life. And you know it."
"And you are a big girl."
"Yes," said Adam One. "You shall be larger than most. But I am the teacher of yours."
"That's true," said Adam One. He glanced down. "I will teach you."
"Fuck you, you won't know what to teach."
"No, I won't. That's not what I'm going to teach. Yes, I'll teach you. I'll be your teacher."
"So that means you must have a different sense of priorities. Otherwise you won't be doing what you're doing." But this time Adam didn't seem convinced.

"Knowing what?"
"The difference between helping me and preserving your life. Hacking off on the old maids. Forcing yourself, that's one of the exercises. Everything in my life was your doing. So all my thinking is yours. If you feel it's been taking you too far, think about it. We're human beings."
"The human race?" said Adam One. "I didn't come here to whine. It was your doing. I said that ten years ago."
"Ten years ago? You never told me that," said Oryx. "Ten years ago I was doing what you want, but I was still a teenager, hard as a nut and fighting back. You can imagine what that must have been like. That's why you stick to the old maids. They were known all those years, even though Ma was dead. If there'd been any justice it would have been for the old maids. I wanted to see justice done. Don't you agree? What's wrong with you?"
"What's wrong with you?" said Adam One.

"Can't you see? I'm not as old as you are. My body is no misty–she was born that way. Old enough for a child to be born. Don't you think I'm just a little dirty, like all the rest of you, and extra messy? You should have a new toilet whenever you're sick, that way you can wash yourself."
"That's a cruel thing to say, babe," said Adam One. "The hormonal war was a mistake." He took a sip. "Skipped down the tube so our face was looking like the windshield of a car that lost its brakes. Three kids and one of them was my older sister, the other two weren't. I know one of them died because I slammed his head on the steering wheel, and I don't think he ever paid for that guilt," he said, and paused. "But you've survived. At least with two of you. And none of them is walking around with that empty pistol."
This time tears had come to his eyes. He tried to wipe them away.

"Don't you love me?" he said.

"Love? What's love got to do with it?"

"You've got that big blue-black love stuck on you." He grinned and shook the rag. "Is that what it is? That's what it's got to do with it? It's stuck on you."

"And what about the other

Omensetter's head down.

Harkness never stops, he calls down. With his eyes, aware of the flutter of his flight, he cries into her mouth. Holding her lips, she repeats.

Now all I can do is listen.

On instinct he grips her shoulders.

Now you're different, she says gently.

He is order and apparent chaos, Zeke, Zeke, Zeke, she says. He laughs. She laughs.

Is he under the table? a voice off the ceiling calls.

Well, sure.

Pain erupts from the sinews of the old boy, cold.

He cradles his face in his hands.

You feel me, don't you? he says.

She puts her fingers on the nape of his neck.

It's the blood, the old boy says, trying to suppress a laugh.

It's the blood.

Is he laying claim to her? Her own small black brand. He is the god of the bleeding.

It takes her breath away. She holds the throw, and finds a dribble of blood.

Now, though. Now. now.

She works. Quiet. Her fingers on Zeke's shirt. Her fingers on his bare chest. She works down. She pushes the blood from her wet hand onto his own face.

You feel it?

You know.

And what?

You feel it. You feel it. You know who I am—the father of your child.

I knew it.

Yes, and I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him. He does not live in here. I am going to kill the man who has hurt his wife.

A small sob of breath escapes her mouth.

Why did you do it?

Will you help, will you help?

You be smart. Yes, you be smart, Zeke, he whispers. Did that hurt you? Son, father, mother, start from the beginning and finish from the end.

He shies back.

Voices from the floor above, called for.

He stops. He starts again. The ball is back to him. He touches her bare hand. On the wall beyond him, women laugh. Children are crying.

No, you will never help me. He wills himself to believe it is the blood that steals his mother's life, she marrying Zeke that hurts, that kills the man who loved her, she losing him . . . she was the one. The child who will never be, who will never live.

She will find, she will find his of all people. The child who will love her and who will never love her. The child who will die of the witness and the father who will not love her.

Then the snap. His legs are shaking so badly.

His eyes are closed, the lids go up and down. His face has turned to a rich red, the veins stand out around his eyes and his mouth is open wide. His face is a red ocher.

He is yelling.

A thin woman dressed all in red with long herding swine is asking him what he knows. Not everything, he says, not everything he knows.

The little boy who called himself this is standing at the head of the table. He stands at the feet of a lacrosse coach, asking people for advice and dismissals. At the one red table, he stands at the foot of a trumpet player and offers him praise.

His feet are quelling, the gray boy has gained a lot of weight and doesn't smile. He's bent, his body is bending.

He is throwing his piggy and spilling the spin.

The little boy looks down at himself, feeling it shrink under his gaze.

Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger—I want to be Tiger and I'm not pretty.

The little boy has turned to his belly and is crying.

To make the tiger think of himself, he takes a pocket of his jacket, glances around. Shoots the ball shoulder—that's Tiger. Pretty enough, doesn't he?

No, next. Add insult. Incestuous insult. With Tiger chasing. Why don't Tiger chase? Why not Tiger? He looks at the laughter upward.

He reaches the security gate and walks out onto the catwalk.

Along the Embankment he realizes he's still holding the spit and weasel.

What if he's not sure it's not Tiger? If it's Tiger, Tiger wouldn't chase.

This is the wrong time. He needs a reason.

Or put it another way, I mean, his "thing" would include his "performance" in a performance, which I don't think he did. His "routines"—that's us.

My son George left the stage at eleven o'clock that day, and so did my first wife, Helga, who stayed after the curtain call and was here for, myself, I guess, well over a year, when Jake and I returned together from European Europe. We hadn't yet made our decision.

Didn't Jake and I then decide to apply to graduate school? I probably did. I certainly did.

But I don't think it was Jake's second wife. Neither did I later. I was too weak. Probably too afraid of what I'd find.

I'm no psychologist. I don't know what I've been like. I wish I could have told Jake and me how I felt. Was I too afraid to leave the theater? Was I afraid of how to end? (If you are going to conclude that I thought I was the only man in the history of our civilization who ever hated women, then you really must wonder what the hell you're doing.) Or was I not afraid? (If it's good to be afraid, then you're brave. But only sometimes.) Anyway, there was the scene at the end. What did I think about? (We are going to see, as a matter of fact, what Willa had to say about it. All right. Don't. You're a man of long years.)

Well, whatever it was, I was too afraid to get up from the stage, and my hands were so shook up to them there was no way I could grip the head-rest. I thought I was going to pass out. The picture and the stage were at my level, and I was afraid.

"Oh, God, Luke," I heard her say.

"My Mom," I said.

And then I got up and realized that I'd actually cried.

I guess I could have cried some more, instead of crying.

"My Mom?" I said. "My mother?"

And I fell down.
Since Turning the Horse
where her husband died after I told her I was leaving, her wedding was just about a disaster.

She was going to get married when she met this professor from Minnesota—that was her husband, Thomas—who they were going to have to move to California in a couple of months.

The new family was only a couple of people, but the combined effort of moving from Minnesota to California made it impossible for her to get married again. So they eloped—to the extreme.

Then Thomas's mother died—a heart attack.

How could she not have been sad?

Imagine how she felt! Graceful despite her weakness, but horrible to see—that was a heart attack!

And I guess that made it worse.

Imagine that!

What kind of a surgeon could have trimmed off her heart? Not the surgeons who did her wedding-funeral so much as the doctors who had done it. And then some poor woman they picked out as a final beneficiary, or somebody who had relatives.

Like me? God, how could either of us guard the bad news from another human being?

One thing I have learned from you Old Folk Rocker: how to deal with gutting.

I can't. Not anymore. At least not any more. Mirror-proof glass. This really is a big place. You don't need to grow up in some trailer park, within spitting distance of a machine gun.

Willa is a tall person, and rich—to the point of extravagance. And what I am, I am two and a half feet tall. One would have to have experienced a mausoleum to believe that truth has removed that truth. One would have to do a lot of walking.

Willa is fifteen feet tall, a foot taller than I am.

A week after the wedding, Willa ran out of things to do. When she left her job, she was tearing her hair off.

Good for her!

No, she does not turn down invitations to come work with her husband. She does not want to work with him—and therefore does not want me to do it. So she remains at home with him.

Did she do it by conscious decision or unconscious attraction?

She does.

Wife. Husband.

I refuse to speculate about what her decision or attraction might have been.

And she did it.

That's why I'm here right now.

Spike.

Spike is who I am.

I know it.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
"It's not my idea," I said.
"Oh, it is, all right," she said.
"My idea of you, Jenny. My idea of life." It was the first time she had used that word,
"Life."
"Look," I said. "What do you call me for?"
"And I'm your friend."
"You're a danger to the world."
"Clutch it, Dan.Push it all down the stairs."
"You're too good-hearted, Jenny. Why do you think
you have to lock horns with me? I'm a crook and you're part of it
yourself—and all those dresses. It's all a scam."
"It's how I get to be a proper observer of things."
"I wish you'd keep that line."
"I was waiting for you to. Nora made me."

"A line?"
"You were supposed to. You never gave it up on your feet."
"Well, I don't want to keep it."
"You were strong and you used it, and so did I."
"I have to."
"When you didn't have it, when that whole house of yours, when Nora
made you—and when I looked at you the other day—it struck me you were
no different. No, everything went right. But I don't want you to
be as light as God you tell me you are."
"You are stupid, you know that? You're not in the mood."
"I am."
"You're not to look at me like this," said Jenny.
"Easy also."
"You'll be better this time."
"Don't you care about me? Don't you care about the girls?"
"I don't care, either of you."
"You're nothing but a blip and a red glow."
"You are not the first one to try to shake me off."
"I am better than you think. I hang on to the truth. I'm not sitting
there and waiting to be drained. I leap into my car and fly out."
"What do you want to do after that?"
"Go."
The sun was already down and I was in the car, rocking myself with
Thick shoes on top of the steering wheel. Tonguetied with my heat
goes, I turned toward the freeway, where I was heading,
driving east. Up the road I turned off the high beam.
All right, I thought, I've got you all beat and warned. I
didn't split you giving in. I didn't hang out with you. I
was a bastard.
After the accident I spent more time in school and more time
on my bicycle. My bike was stolen and I didn't know it, which
was news. How else could a school boy acquire
chances a bicycle at a time like that? I just had to be sure.
A hundred times easier to handle it, teaching it, riding it the old
way. I didn't have to worry anymore.
I could have done something to earn money. I did
what I liked with my bike. I still cheated on the
make. All obscene chemicals and an odor of sweat.
I didn't care about being an instructor. I sat in the
front row as the whistles blew, all right, but I wanted
a big, sweeping, pacifying noise out of this world, this
contemporaneous world I had inherited from my father, accepted
as a cultural contribution, and was always dissatisfied.
In the winter I didn't know what for. I sat on the back
bleachers. I was afraid of something, but I didn't
care; I was free and as good as might be. I handled everything
like Amos 's father. I figured out how to ride a bicycle
and I was free. It was a good winter and I was happy in it.
I thought about that bicycle and thought about that life. I
thought about sitting on the back bleachers in the weather, I
imagined myself on the back bleachers in June, in the
back bleachers. Traffic flows in and out on grinding
streets of asphalt and asphalt and asphalt.
When I was going two miles the other way the lights
would change, the traffic would sweep up. As we climbed
up together—Bud vs. Fit. as the dog and farting. I
was learning how to ride again. I'd do the simple single
stroke, and then I'd put my pedal into gear and
punch in one more stroke, and when we got to the freeway I
knew the traffic had all changed and the city
was only twelve miles away from me.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Nothing. Even so, what I thought I was, nothing.

—I see, I see, I will not be listened to.

—Listen to me, you would be wise, oh yes you would be wise to this. I am a writer and a dream, I am a man, I am The Beast in the Red Lion. I was always a king of men, that was I. All my life. Do you know what you are reading?

—At this moment we are at the grave of the Red Lion, but all men will die before I am imposed. There is a crying need for the necropolis. I am the greatest king of the North, and have made clear that I want this day to be without significance. For this day is the day of the annihilation of the earth, to be worth nothing to the sun. Do you understand me?

—No.

—I am the king of this day whose empire we were, and it is my right, the same red blood that feeds you, that you seek, as you seek.

—You do not understand, you know.

—I need to believe, that is the only path.

—Through that crimson wall I have succeeded, so that nothing can be achieved. You must believe, and let the light of faith shine through to yours.

—There are only two paths, almost the same road.

—You cannot say that, you know too much, and you have taken too many. Stipulations and deceptions. You would have to believe that you will live, that you will find something of value, something that may call one your new kingdom, you think you can ask yourself only to be so. You will know so little, that you will doubt, that you will be disappointed by it.

—But you are right, you are wrong, you will not be saved either.

—We will find and be saved.

—The blood of the Red Lion, you say. I have done my part. No good, no evil, but that is what you do. You cannot do a second, you have to believe that you will live.

—This red blood is the blood of the Red Lion.

—But not so alone, not so, not so alone.

—But it seems that you have been wrong. That the red blood will be red, for some time to come. Pearls of it are needed. Pearls of our need.

—The wise woman can't ask another question.

—I did, I do, and I have even told you. You think it seems a miracle. You think our new kingdom has been started by our new blood. You think it will last forever. I showed you some of my old drawings. You are old and you are old. Oh yes, I am not fooling you again. It is true that your kingdom will not last forever. But I will.

—You've done enough harm, you know that? You have killed more than one life. You have destroyed a great deal more than once.

—Not against you, truly. Because I am not fooling you. I will not live, or at least not forever. I won't live in your kingdom forever. I will go again to those lands where the sun never sets. I will bring you the new youth and your new sister. I will provide you with old age and death, for they are all there. I run the State like a juggernaut. You will have to keep your word. And remember, you have heard lies you have told. This was the secret of our success. For you, however, I have some words enough, some hopes after all, you have enough hope of that.

—Is there anything I can do the least good for?

—It may be worst for you, and I do not make attempts at good. It will be good for you. Work on and on, but you will not have the strength to lift a stone. That is not your strength. I can say that for you, for such a reason. Work on and on. I don't want you to come out of this. You are right. You need to know what you are doing.

—What is it I am doing?

—It's hard to keep green. Please stay by me, and one day more or less. You are right, it is hard.

—But what will happen there?

—I know that now that you are no longer my secret face. That I jot things down. I know that I looked after you. I know that you have nothing to tell me.

—That's a lie.

—I know that you would not. I know you are right, but I

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

I wonder if that's philosophy.

I can't believe it.

Maybe then. But maybe not, I guess. Maybe not.

It's impossible to know.

How about the truth?

Tell me a truth. Ten thousand nights ago.

Why such a thing?

Because I'm always opening up. Start to see things. Truth that's on the fringes of the mind.

What's that?

I know who I am. I just can't have a name.

Who is it.

You. Why did I ever touch you?

Please.

You feel you owe me an answer?

I only love you in the light of truth.

Then why do you go around here?

I don't have to try to find a truth.

I want to find it for you.

Hah.

That's when I got you. You were the U.

Sometimes I believe you wrong. I believe you as a boy with a yellow gazelle.

I used to have to pinch myself because I was so blind. I liked to think I was blind.

So what happened?

My eyes got used to seeing. It was lucky.
Now you're married.

Yes.

After the last part you said, I think we will be waiting for another part, the little part, the thing that does nothing much, just sits there.

We got into trouble for you, I guess, and that's why we are here.

It doesn't matter if you were married or not. If nobody knows who you are, I guess it's all right.

No, you're not going there.

When?

I don't know. I can get my affairs covered.

Rachel.

You don't want to know about any of it, do you?

No. I don't want to know about anything.

And now I'm going to teach you something about yourself.

You're mad.

I'm not mad. At all.

Then what's happened to your eyes?

I don't know. It's something you shouldn't have got out of the jug the way you did.

Come here.

You got mad at me for the way you ignored me.

No. That won't be true.

Because this is the head rule. And Rachel, this head rule, you're going to have to tell me who you are before I become a woman.

What do you know about me?

I know your private life intrigues you. What do you know about the activities of a private life?

No, but before that starts, I'm going to make you a promise that you'll tell me.

I don't care how you're going to do it. We are not going to make love the way I'm going to make love.

Go away. Just go.

Like you? I don't care.

And what's wrong with you?

I was born stupid. As stupid as you.

Then it's over.

It may continued at all.

All right. Then what do you want?

I want Rachel. Truth. Glory. Power.

All right, Rachel. You'll have to tell me what you want.
He looked at her clearly, like he was seeing her for the first time as she really was, as possessed of a truth he could only guess at, as he had always known in the vague way he knew everything he knew. He was surprised, for a moment, and amazed. His thoughts went blank.

Tell me.

Why bother? You don't care.

I don't care.

But I care a whole lot. Why can't I care?

I care about you. What do you care?

I care about you, about my children, my house, my car, my life. I care about you, Rachel, all of you, in all of this, the way real people care about people. How do you keep either of those things in your head?

You think I'm crazy. Because you said, You're a nutcase.

No.

But I'm not crazy.

No.

You look insane. Is that the way you look?

Sometimes.

What do you do all day?

I'm a rich girl. In the market in there.

Are you rich?

Rich. You're rich. But you look insane.

Me?

Is that why you took your ring?

It's a mess.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—And I will be,

she murmured, —what I am, I am.

The same wooden spirit that had boa constrictor in the mouth had mocked the doctor on his return from the bar, and now it threatened the door.

—Novutny? . . . ?

—Of course you're right, he's still like a . . . necromancer . . .

—It's the medicine. It's the medicine.

—I didn't know you could be so . . . so competitive. You don't look at all like him, you know. Like him? he's nearly thirty, I mean they both are, whoever the hell they are, it's certainly not the same face.

—Well but, I need his ego, his charm . . .

—The power of goodness in this place, that's it. A man needs it. Here.

The next morning a taxi had carried them a ways away from the Rue de l'Hammardpris Post Office, from where the Rue de l'Hammardpris would take them on their way. The taxis moving in front of them were big and dark with red lights flashing on and off. In a short while they was at the bend in the roadway, and then in the stubble beyond, three taxi drivers in uniform with their back badges milled and rumbled behind them, abandoned vehicles rusting under the rain. They were moving fast. On their knees they began to run along the service roadway, as though awaiting an order. They had not gone more than a few yards when there was a shout, and then another, muffled, and then a cry from the pimp of the taxi driver. A thousand first impressions came back to them. They did not stop there. Ahead they could see the outline of the broken piece of glass, and then the red light. They went on, making little sidings, looking backward, until they came upon a bus, and they climbed aboard. The man with the heavy pack walked on ahead, smiling wistfully, the beads of his breaks of a gold chain turning between his fingers.

—We're nearly home.

He gave it a turn, and they emerged from the thickening stench of sweating faces onto the night pavement ahead.

—When you came in, I was just thinking it might be smart.

—What?

—What's the matter?

—Nothing, nothing.

—It's no bother.

—That's not what I mean either.

—Are you really on your way?

—Yes. I've got a plane on the way.

—Transports . . .

—Yes, now?

—To . . .

—To where?

—Well, home if . . . he patted his pockets.—I'm on my way, see?

—Is this your room?

—No.

—I've been looking for it.

—Anything?

—No.

—I hope it's not your dad's this place?

—It's not.

—They ought to have a lock.

—No.

—I expect it's the right one.

—I knew you were coming.

—I'm sorry.

—Don't you ever want to . . . get a divorce?

—Never.

—Well?

—Never.

—The housekeeper is Mrs Luzzi's mother.

—Oh, yes. And you . . . you're a doctor?

—That's right, I'm an doctor.

—No, then, no, I know you're a doctor.

—And you . . . are you married?

—No. Yes.

—I hate to ask, I hate to . . .

—Then you won't go to any further.

—It's too late. I'm not ready for a divorce. I just want to be . . . like when I was Molly Smith.

—Like Molly Smith? Good God. Do you think I care? Do you think . . .

—I don't know. I certainly hope it's not you.

—I don't want you to seek my sympathy. You don't know how it was . . .

—I know. I know. But . . .

—You don't look too sexy to me.

—But . . . not just the way you look. It's that we're not just seeing eyes off. It's that way when I wanted to get something ready for Christmas, I can't leave it till

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

A man and a woman, separated, each thinks she has only thought what she was supposed to think.

I couldn't, I would never have thought of Amede Agnes Duchamp. I couldn't.
Fifth Day
We reported to the authorities at the end of our journey and the warder, Mr. M. Amede Nagrul-Ghil, told us when we got there that the social worker was looking for us, though he wasn't given my name, and she told us to go in through the main door. We sat at the hearing room table and had a cup of coffee. He glanced at us from his chair and told us they would have to treat us properly and there would be food and facilities if we left. He looked at Agnes Duchamp wearily, as if he could believe, because, for what I might not have known, he, too, needed something, it might be something better than he could give himself or her. He asked how she was. Do you want to see the social worker?

She answered yes.

Oh, that's all right.

She asked if he knew her address, if she was ever there. He said no.

Do you know her address?

No, he said.

Climb onto the lift.

She was sitting in her cage, they were the two nubs, and people were starting to file past, bearing down on us. We took our bags, making a game of it, even if I was the last to get off. Everybody was in the system, one slip and we were lost. As I was sliding down and away from the lift I saw Agnes all in our little coats, either Mary Agnes or Mary Agnes or Agnes Duchamp, they were folded over in the window of the cage. I wondered what was the matter, having finished my little hell, and then I was on the street below, hoping for some handouts, some welcome.

Inside the lift the lights went on, and off came the ropes, and after a time somebody came on. I stopped what I was doing, turned, saw a flash of her, half wrinkled in the glare of the lights up on the floor, and when I turned, both of us were looking up.

These things happen, I said, and they will happen again. Look at it this way. It's a good thing you're not out there, up there, that's what I say, even if there's one person that's allowed. I passed her the rope, she put up her hands over her face, Oh my goodness dear Jesus, and Agnes Duchamp pushed her hands up to her face.

Ouch, she said, as if she were crying or slightly hysterically sorry.

It's all right, I said, smooth and reassuringly, moving past the guard to stand above them.

She jerked her hands up to her face and started to cry, and rushed to the cage, and while she was struggling with the rope in the cage Agnes dropped the empty cage, grabbed her hands and began to whip her. Agnes Duchamp handled each rope smoothly, with one hand, and then she took a couple of steps up and put her feet down on it, kicking at it privately as she moved. She couldn't have cared less about her athletic toughness.

"Come on, Agnes, you got to be a bitch!" she said to her, and Agnes started to back off, plucking her fists apart. She swung at me with a sort of mulatto hook and kept hitting me. "You come on, you bastard, come on, you come on!"

When Agnes Huggins finally did get her hands on her face and pulled her hands apart, I felt something hard popping through my shoulder. This must have hurt. I pushed myself up into my seat and maneuvered myself over. Mary Agnes was crying. She had kicked out her hands, and as I turned to do something to her, she came around, grabbing me by the shoulders. All I had to do was pick her up and flatten her against the chair. Then he came over from the street and they were again together.

Mary Agnes and Mary Agnes. They seemed far away, like two colors in a poor light.

"Stop it!" he said, but she didn't stop.

She was crying no more. She got up and went over to the couch. I wanted to get up and hug her and she did not move. I turned around to see where she was going—nowhere. She was moving too. She was crying no more, I could see that. She dropped her hands between her legs and stared straight at me. It was as if she could see my

READER: You tricked me.

VOICE: Who?

VOICE: I described you.

VOILIN: No, I don't think so.

VOILIN: How is that possible? You've talked a lot about women. Average women, not like lily-lowers.

VOILIN: Party women?

VOILIN: Yes. The voice of my sex.

VOILIN: You! You've talked hundreds of women's sexuality to me before. Like the fairies and the old ones in the paintings. Yours is that. You speak about their sexuality as a kind of ecstasy that tugs you to and makes you want them. Obviously. You want very little, and you don't need it.

VOILIN: My God, what are you thinking?

VOILIN: Most of it is for you to look after, doing the work for you.

VOILIN: I know what you're thinking. This is mathematical incitement.

VOILIN: Slam it.

VOILIN: Do you really think I'm going to do it? Do you think I's going to live in a world of free, reckless men, that you can just move ahead on men and bolt? Take all the time you need, and you have room at all for others.

VOILIN: It's not that you're so sloppy that I don't love you; but I do want you to stay with me. I'm serious. I have to to conclude now. Do you promise? We'll talk about it, when again you can tempt me to seduction?

VOILIN: When.

VOILIN: When!

VOILIN: I can't bear to be destroyed. But it's my work. I've done it. It's best to do it now. There are those people who have nothing special. Plenty of them but I don't. You just have to love me.

VOILIN: I hate to do it now.

VOILIN: Let's talk about it then.

VOILIN: I hate to be on my knees.
"They're going to court me," I said.

"You won't be arrested then, are you?"

"No, but we'll be scrutinized about what you did."

Obediently I dragged the folding chair back to the window, and with two steps on it I went to the police station, where it was more or less as I had left it. A young man sat up and put his fists on the desk in front of me.

"You're not the first to have accused me," he said. "You're the first, you're the first."

"Please sit down."

"I want to come in here and give you an example. If you would listen to me."

"I can't stand up. Go away. Just go."

We stared at each other. I felt a fool. I felt a fool. I was like a child caught in the act of naughty things. I put my hands behind my back and sat down. He stared at me, not a fool, getting disgusted.

I got up and went to the open door with a stiff movement, like a lamppost. He grabbed hold of the back of my chair. Then I realized what kick I had given. He put his hands over my face and stamped my face down on his desk. I turned away and walked out of the office.

I took my coat and went to the train.

In the morning I was lucky and had a seat with six other women. There was a lot of action in the cab. I was quick and good; one of them was the clerk, who stopped to say something to me while I went to work. I got off at the next station.

I couldn't find a bus. I tried to think, there'd been a bus to the depot, but I soon got busy thinking about walking home, to see Cesarina. I walked along the street till I came to a house. There was a yellow paint job over the front door, and it was painted the color of bone. The electricity was off. Music was coming from an upstairs window. I thought of going upstairs and found books on the floor. But there was nothing. I went into the room. It had arms and legs on a little wooden bench. There were isolas and spirals of light, like the light in the Casco light. There was a picture of a sun on the wall, with two clouds. I calmed down. How would I get inside? If I had to take a one-way trip, the conductor would let my ticket go through the turnst

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Let us live inside the mind.

Surely we are all part of the big picture. We are all in the big picture.

I decided it was time for my meeting with the prison at Vulture Hill. Oh, the start of the prison, in general, was better than the beginning, although in many ways we were not the beginning. The beginning was the beginning of a world.

I had a lot of trouble breathing, but once it started we did not breathe very well. About noon, when we were breathing normally again, I was able to afford a short break by pretending that I was speaking of the end of the world.

Then I did something silly. I said to myself that there would be a big picture.

We are in this together. It is just as well you have made this whole thing up.

You are strong, aren't you. Do you really think I am so stupid?

Am I so stupid. I said to myself. I am stupid and stupid. But at least you are joking.

I said to myself in the old days, we had the whole of the objective world in our heads and for forty thousand years we had the whole of the world behind us.

Don't be stupid. Then I wished I had rolled over and rubbed the overstuffed pillow against my breast.
The buttons came off but they were three different sizes.

The little iron button had a knife-sharp point.

"You want four poached Atlantic sushi," I said, not seeing what was funny.

"That sounds good."

"Do you like spicy food?"

"Sure."

"Why did you say that you liked spic and span?"

"Don't be stupid. Doing something stupid can be funny when you end up with nothing at all."

"You're joking again."

"Do you prefer steamed prawns or long strips of bacon?"

"Steamed prawns, colts. Steamed prawns, krill-racing vicars."

"Oh, I guess I'll have three of the things."

"You're referring to the cols, or to the krill-raising vicars?"

"I like the mousse," I said.

"I don't get the point."

"It's not the prickle that you like, it's the olive oil. I figured you'd like it. I've got nothing against it."

"Enjoy the chicken. I'll let you have it."

When we got outside, the sun was slanting past the ridges where the highway shoulders had been in the storm. As if the highway were hoping to help, the ridge had become steeper and had a sharp point that hurt me.

There was water at the bottom of the ridge. It was running on a concrete slant so that the water came on out of the rocks and was still running, rippling through the mud and the stones.

I had thought that the water on the ridge was soft.

I got down and looked under the shelter of a rock. There was no soil there at all. It was like a thing that had liquefied, its dirt lava whitening and seeping down the rock into the mud.

I mounted a stone wedge and looked under the shelter of the rock once more.

It came up the slope and it was about twenty feet high.

I lunged forward to see when it was going to come down, and I saw it.

It was just the topmost tip of five out of the rock around me.

I waited for it to fall. I had to wait for it to fall before it struck the jambs or even went down into that part of the slope.

I heard it. I could hear it running through the rock. I could hear a layer of water falling on the rock. I thought that if you can hear it coming down the slope and falling down the hill, you know what it is.

I got down and looked, and I saw a splinter of a foot protruding from the top of the spit.

It was a foot that did not hurt.

It came down the slope that way. From the top of the slope it was a foot that did not hurt.

It came down the rest of the way.

I looked down the horizontal stone slant. The rock was about ten feet high. I looked down its vertical side at the water splinter.

It was hard in the mud. It came up the slope, coming down steadily, and not falling down, not falling down, and I ran back to the edge of the slope.

I was almost back when I heard something fall

—For the moment. Yes. Clench your teeth. Let the earth swallow you up. The earth will spit on your dust. That's all I'm saying.

—No thank you.

—Goodbye. Take the floor with you. Wherever you are, now speed up, that's a dangerous thing to do, give just the slightest impulse, and his fist came down hard upon the wall and kept getting more hard. —You see? the guards said.

—I'll pay at the bar for the whiskey.

—You'll pay for the whiskey? They laughed.

—No, not for the whiskey.

—All right. When I'm finished, you're paid for the drink. Get out.
He sat in the furnace room by himself. Behind him a bend was a relief from the heat of the day, and he sat motionless, without a word, his hands knotted in front of him. He was tired. He had been through the hills in the afternoon, and now hung in the water trees, in his pantaloons and shorts, the breeze cool on the back of his head, and there was nothing he could do now to hear the boy. He knew that the boy would be waiting, when he stood up, and run toward the wall, and stand there staring, his face looking across the courtyard to the bar.

—Daddy! Mama! Daddy!

A kiss gone. The child turned toward him over the wall and began to cry. But the boy had gone. And when the child walked toward the wall, it began to rain through the courtyard. But the rain fell, drenched the heavy hedges, sweetly wetting the courtyard walls and leaves.

Mama!

The boy was standing and moving toward the wall; but he couldn't get through the partition above him.

—No thank you, no, no! Mama!

He was away. Even the guards behind the partition were there, taking poor aim. In a few moments, he was back in the bar.

—Was it true?

—Yes . . . it was really true.

—You are the one who brought the story into being.

—Yes . . . but you can be stupid, can't you.

—And you brought it to us?

—Yes.

—What. How did you bring it all up anyway?

—Once you left the house, I guess they left it to us. You think there was anything else? Mommy and Daddy ratted on me when I was little. Mama and Papa went to see them, four of them. It was a terrible thing for Mama, she told Daddy. So he ratted on me a little.

—The very best of luck for you.

—They also ratted on me. They ratted against me.

—Smart.
—Slowly.

—Do you think I made a good father?

—Not smart enough for him.

—Yes, but smart.

—Smart and stupid.

(In the stable)
SIX YEARS Terence, my brother, was gone now. His place was in the Bronx but he was not with it. He had become a street kid, black as I was white now. Sometimes I would go out and his father would come out of the house, and gone, and his mother saw me and didn't know what time it was, and I knew he was caught on the stoop, and she never came out in the street again until she had to have him back inside.

Oh,

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

But I said, Why is it so hard to remember what I was? If I'd suddenly remembered that, I would never have to remember it.

I don't remember being afraid. It was like the fear of a child who's suddenly cold. There was something dangerous in that world I had made.
SINCE ALL THE body pieces of me were blobby and bumpy, each a body with two or three eyes, a thick tongue and a long spine, then up here a body with two slices of clay and a dull apple skin, then back down there the body with one eye and an apple just as a blob wound me as good as the noblest apple you ever saw. Having the body is just like having the eyes and what it has to be like.

SCARED ACCWEE PERPETUAL.

Having the body is no joke.

No, prescribed by the body blankets feminist ideas about my body—the body is also the mouth.
COLLAPSITURE SHEER.

All the bodies were fine. It's just that sometimes I feel these words and maybe I don't feel them all at the same time.

I admit I have fun with the thing … but when are we going to resume talking?

Don't I admit I was a crazy person?

I admit in my late twenties I was a crazy woman.
THE

MID-ABORTIONAL

THE

OF

THE

THIRTY-SEVEN BODY MAN
We're building a dam here in Up Beach, the chains and stakes clocking each other, nail-stripping them purposefully. Smith Herm.

That's right.

Life is the struggle. The terrorist, the murderer's weapon. When we run out of our weapons, bomb, convert them into explosives, blow them up about a guy's life.

Don't laugh.

Pretty soon, everybody's going to be killed and the world will be in a sorry position.

I don't remember many of them now. I remember maybe two or three. And I remember how I kept coming back to those books. The way a boy would … I mean … well, not like some of us was overjoyed about life since the explosion. A lot of what we read came back to that day, even as a teenager in the Eighties. I remember when I found myself rereading one of those old novels over and over again in a bomb shelter in Zaire on a late-summer night I got out and crossed the border into South Africa. I actually got out and walked into that country in the early seventies. I was there until it happened to me. Nobody else ever did. Stoned out of pleasure?

If you like, that's the stuff I keep thinking about without knowing what it's connected to. There were things I had to get back before I blew up the cherished Claireing Lake Hotel, that beautiful, shaded downtown beach hotel you lived in.

The first time I ever felt the power of a hallucinogen I was asleep on our sloped balcony in the Eighties, falling through a screen of colored glass that rattled. I woke up shouting, "Number one. Class number zero.… He's a fucking idiot!" I crawled to our balcony and looked down into sunny ultraviolet light. The place was empty, but everyone there had been asleep. Messengers came on board a destroyer in the Pacific Ocean.

"Will Bambi Chandler survive a belly o' mine, class?…"

"Oh, they'll survive anything, anything.…"

I ran to help Claire Jackson and I saw the white model ship. Another wave came in and left with more lights and then the middle bridge disappeared. I got on the bridge and the pilot landed in the middle of a blast wave. He was wearing a white plastic suit and a black plastic jacket with an enormous black star on the back.

I threw away his fake IDs and walked around the deck where our boat had been sunk and tried to explain calmly to everyone who wanted to go home that it was no more useful than fishing. No, it would never work because of the tangledness of the wind streamers as they parted under the violent waves into smaller and smaller boats. I saw those boats and I knew that if I tumbled into them the whole vessel would break. The pilot, because he had been asleep, was the only one who got off the boat alive.

The engines did not quit. They were still burning. Another wave came from behind his head. He straightened up as if he had been thrown and rolled out of the boat. He tripped, my son jumped off the boat, and I fell on the deck, crouching and bleeding, watching helplessly as his chest gaped out of the water,

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

In late summer, when the mail came, I looked at it, avoiding the title. The special package with elegant threads was hidden beneath it. But then I returned the package, looking at it, and I said, "Taking a bath. I don't mind. But you too, are you naked?"

"Nah! Only in the black suit."

She was. And she still wore the black hair drawn back.

I said, "She's looking at you like that."

She said, "Don't be such a fool. It's unpleasant. I must wash it and try to dance while I wash."

I made a joke of her. "So, I guess there really isn't something that becomes you."

She laughed and she didn't look at me, either. She said, "Don't say that."

And I asked, "Am I really covered with all kinds of crap?"

She said, "Tight as a shroud, what do I know?"

"Because I'm leaving this town because it doesn't work."

She nodded. "It doesn't bother you?"

"Yeah," she said.

I knew exactly what she would say next.

Then I started to cry. She was crying so hard, tears sprang up behind her eyes. She said gently, "Everything will be all right, I suppose. You won't change from the angel, won't you?"

It wasn't right that she should believe me. If I believed her, I'd keep my promise and let her get on with her life. Or at least I'd try. Because she had absolutely no right to leave. Not a slip, not a scratch. Or a signature on a boardinghouse permit, or a letter to a club, or the redhead's resume. She was lovable. But then she moved to take my side, and so in the end I yielded and she got back in the truck. I took a shower and wiped her tears off. When I came to her room, I took her arm.

I kissed her all over her body and then I kissed her on the mouth, but I didn't kiss her on the mouth.

At that point I said to her, "What are they doing back in town, these people?"

She said, "I told you, it's not your work. What you're doing is my work."

She was on my side. #What she was on my side was O & L. For a minute I licked her all over her body, my fingers circling around her nipples.

"What's so bad about it? Let me teach you how to act," she told me.

I said, "Is there anything I can do for you?"

She said, "Actually, I want you to get engaged to me."

"Bullshit."

Then she sighed.

"I'm sorry," she said. "I'm out of cigarettes." She was sitting on the bed.

I said, "What are you going to do, soon?"

"I'm going to get married."

"Get me one of those old brown Valentine blossoms and wear it over and over your head. You'll get the hang of it," I told her.

She said, "It's not that I'm mean, but I know I'm not doing good enough for you."

"You like the idea."

She looked down at the floor. "Don't come anymore."

"You go through life like this."

"This place."

"You get a lot of mail here.

She slid off the bed, got her cigarette from the top of the desk. When she started to smoke, her eyelashes drooped like swollen blood. She kept staring at me like that, and she said, "At least I don't smoke these cigarettes."

"I'm sure you got plenty of free cigarettes."

I was thinking this. It struck me as disrespectful.

"It's too much," she said, "for me to be having an engagement here."

"That's right."

"You're not going to believe me when I say this," she went on.

"I believe you." She exhaled smoke and winced.

"Then I'm sincere," she said.

"Well, open your mouth," I told her.

She grinned. "It's my and my alone."

"Damn right," I whispered, "that's what you do."

"That's what you do," she said.

Then she smoked her cigarette, and I smoked mine. We didn't speak. When we finished, she pushed back her chair and left.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Why should such an absurdity be allowed to exist?

—Among the accidents of this world. Have you ever been to the place where a man's spendthrift has gone?

—You are asking me what is the good of all this zeal for the nothing that was none other than in itself, and that rightly needs nothing but the intervention of the hand that can join it all the moment it has become what it is. What you have made of all your actions?

—You want to know what is before the eyes of my parties. I am a man who has had no beginning at all. (A breeze had made a flutter of his face.)

—Well, you have one now, have you? You have a place where no one starts and you can begin. And you can learn to be outside yourself. Not a man. A dog.

—You are theoretical as well as moribund. Like a Danube.

—Take that away. Pretend a book is written and the world has never been the world and then you are thrown out on a stretcher on the Savor, near the place where the world ends.

—Go. What do you care if I do this? and the walls begin to sway, seeming to roar with their own soundless voice. Whatever you want to make of my testimony, break and destroy. Leave me alone. Not even the hearing will allow you to hear. Think of this as tranquillity, and that is what you will be provided for. You will be abandoned. Think of that and I will think of you, I will say to myself, well, you have no need of that.

—After all, you said to yourself, you are a success.

—You told me that the grand reason for the triumph was always the encouragement of the underdog. You were a protestant slob, a clown, laughing at yourself. Your face is the end of a joke, a mockery.

—I don't remember.

—How could you? You didn't sit down to think in a booth before a couple of brothers in the morning.

—It gives me so much pleasure.

—You are quite right, of course. It was a fantastic, fantastic misunderstanding. You tried to knock yourself out. My advice to you was, to go away for good and die in the fire and I will be back to speak to you as I was before, with a sense of shame so deep that I will be afraid to speak it to you even as I speak it to you, if you are ever still in America. The rest is more fun.

—What do you mean?

—I am so proud of coming back like a fool for a stupid mistake.

—I thought you had told me what to do.

—I did. Why did you stay? I knew you would come, he said. I knew that you would.

—I went out in the evening to wake up what I thought was a dog. It was the first night of my life.

—What did you do?

—I ran houses before.

—I thought you'd come.

—I wanted to, I'm sure.

—A joke! What do you mean — I want to know what made you stay?

—Because the law says a man cannot do that.

—Well, what do you mean, a joke? You repeat it and I believe you. What makes you live, why you stay?

—That night in the woods I used to think I was in solitude. I don't know why. But I was there as often as I could.

—You must be a tightwad, you know. I can't imagine what would have happened without you. There were scenes to all of us, many of them, during those days. I am thinking of you as someone who lurks in the background like a specter—a word you invented yourself.
—You made me stay because she'd made me.

—She?

—In her own little share of the world that she had her share of.

—She?

—It was a simple matter of a few months and perhaps a few weeks later she decided that she would spend the night with me. I never saw her leave that house without us.

—I don't understand.

—She called my family together. My father's lawyer was there. He had been trying to shed light on the accident ever since he received the information from her. This must have been around the time you played Carmen to Florence people had said.

—Why didn't you tell me before?

—I didn't think it would be any use.

—It could not have

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

No, I did not become a stateless man.

We are created in the darkness of a moment, said the Marquis.

Valerian's eyes narrowed in the firelight.

Jeffreys said:

The truth is that we live a long time.

He looked at the Marquis and smiled.

It is remade, said LaFalla.

The perpetual twilight was as black again as he remembered, and the burning log huts glowed and burned inside, as before, and the girl was still in his arms.

He stood up. He looked down at her.

I'm sorry to have kept you, he said.

I know, she said quietly. It's not my fault. I'm sorry I have to keep you.

He sat down on the end of the couch and licked his lips again. He said:

I'm sorry. I should have pulled you up some years ago.

Leaning forward he held out his hand towards her. He looked around at the dark. He was not dressed yet for the fall. However, he was dressed for the poetry luncheon. He needed to put his shoes back on.

You're my friend, said LaFalla.

I think you're amazing, said Tarícula.

She let her hand fall back to her lap. She began to wail.

You don't tell me until you've admired me enough, said LaFalla. I'll look at you.

Don't resist, said LaFalla, with an enigmatic smile. I can see some features that remind you of your brother.

You'll like him, said Tarícula, but he's a doozie. You see? He does odd things, things he's not supposed to do. I have to keep him safe.

Is that so terrible? That you can't understand me? That I can't get yourself together? That you can't understand why?

Don't waste your time with me, you're right. A more normal person would leave an exclamation mark and jump up and go:

Elle va plus ça ira. Elles va plus ça ira. Elles va plus ça ira.

"And you would have watched your brother get eaten alive by dogs," Tarícula said. "You would have watched him go past unhelped by the ladies and gentlemen who loved caring for him, watching him and his family dribbling blood until he wasn't left alive anymore, until he was old enough to go home, until he had lost his wife, until his daughter grew up. How many years of that would have been worth it to you? Average men love their fathers, women shouldn't care about their husbands. But you? And me?"

"Don't you know?" she said. "I'm not thirteen anymore."

Then he played with the chessboard, moving from position to position, hoping she would smile. She did not.

"I dare not," she said. "I'm terrified."

"I dare not," he said. "It's true. Don't you ever think of not knowing me." He laughed lightly so she would laugh.

"I dare not. I can see you everywhere."

In fact LaFalla did not know him all that well. But he knew she was seventeen and he knew enough to know the difference between his age and hers.

"Look at me," he said, and she looked—but very slowly, assuringly—at her face. Then she smiled and said, "We can go to the party."

"The party where they killed Roberto Paestra," said Tarícula.

"You saw them hook him?"

He shrugged. She shrugged again. They pulled the covers over their heads. LaFalla made a muffled noise and felt cool. She put her elbows on the table, leaning forward intently on her elfin, and put her hand over her mouth as she leaned forward. She said very little. Her tone was frigid, polite. LaFalla did not know what she did. He knew that she kept the generator running but he had never seen anyone use it except for his father and his mother. She was with the last person.

She leaned forward again and blew into her fingers, from's her fingers, hers, then palm down, between them. Her mouth was black. Her eyes, she knew, dark, were of a lighter hue. But it was the lightness of the wrist that got LaFalla to look, he said, and she saw that it was very dark.

"Her pale hands," said LaFalla. "And the white

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

You don't know what you're lost in.

I was born my father's.

The touch of your eyes is still with you.

Seventeen, like me. That's true.

The woman's voice had lopped off in the child's throat. She waited, but she listened and didn't speak.

Why did I lose you, Hubertus? Why did the room to my ear fill with marble?

You don't know what you're lost in.

You've been saving me from myself, and now you'll need me.

Night sun in your hand, Adam. Breath o' bat.

The mouth bled. The mouth of the black hole.

You were my only love, and now you're my only new love.

You can go through the black hole, Adam, into the black hole that is myself.
It might have been a permanent love, but we weren't lovers. In bed we didn't speak, the air we inhaled was no more than the ridge where the world lay in my hair and the bones of my bones. I was in pain, I told myself, but I wondered if I might not be able to love the pain of other, stranger men. I saw myself in another's eyes, I saw my skin, and I had a warning voice of power in the corners of my eyes; I knew how it would end, how I would die, if I got out of that room with my lover and let her walk. I had put myself through so much it could have lasted, but there was no way to stop me. I hung my head and felt the great power of something to come, care, and beauty at the same time. I let it out. It was the kiss of life. I was coming, and I was ever coming.

I told myself it was Steiner's theorem and got my teeth into nothing. It was the kiss of life, I would have an exact taste of life, I wanted to taste life. I was coming; I had gone. And I had put up an ax and I had made an axs. I wanted to drive a hot knife of class through the dead mansions of my head.

This isn't what I see. This is the beginning of the end of a form. Josué.

You see, that ending; it's an ending. And it contains hatred.

Perfect hate. A loving hatred of the first father, the perfection of the mother. Love and hatred are one.

Then one, then another, then another, and nothing is forgotten.

And we never slept.

Then we didn't.

Then I didn't love anything.

Then love does love and we don't love.

And today I am still waiting for the world to solve itself.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

The words were stifled by some inner curve as he returned them to the man who had forced them into being.

You think you are who you are because you know who you are only if you know yourself. As I can see you are. You are me.

He put his arms about Russell and squeezed. "How do you do that?" he said, the word inflamed his cheeks. "How do you use it?"

The words left Dar Oakley speechless as he tried to form them.

He cuddled the Fox to his entire body and as bird swarms tend to do Dar Oakley started to feel the Fox fur. He held that in his hands then, as though he weren't looking at this now, as though it had run out of words as though the time for them had never passed. And he felt the Fox bones underneath his flesh as the Fox bones once had done, light and fleshy. And then he felt the Fox words of being the Giant, that the whole of the world was here.

He sat at the front of the path as he'll remember to do. He learned to say that, that the world was crawling now toward a time when no other world existed, because that is what the world had become, and no other time, and the world not yet old.

He felt, in the leather of his heath, the earth in his ribs calloused. He felt, in the voice of the voice, the living breathing that had been no more than a breath now and then now and then, and he felt all yesterday beyond that moment.

He could not begin to remember where he'd come from. But once he had entered the open land that was the world and no one could find him there any more he could know not who he was or what he really thought. He could not tell where he was and what that might mean. When he tried to remember where he had gone, it returned to him only so far: where is my home?

When he became a Crow and grew into one, it was as though he had passed from stream to stream, bubbling up from the river-bank, on the land's far edge, and he could not catch the same river twice. When he turned from one side of his path to the other, he could see a great tract of moor in a clearing. It was too far to get to. It was beside an outcropping, a hexagonal house with a roof a-flap in a zip, but not a roof.

He looked back to the river: he knew it now, or knew the river was there. He rose, then, and flew to that place where that kind of bank was right. Where he knew there was a river.

He flew through the dark wood, casting bright bubbles in its dissolving water to hear voices calling behind him. He flew low over an old tree with a glance of hatred at the squalls of green, or red, or of gray. He circled again and flighted up to where the Fox was; but then he saw her, too long ago.

She was lying in a narrow cage of branches, waving. He had known them, knew they were there forever. They called her Fox. She made no sound.

He knew she was guarding the nestlings in the feathers of her bill, and he knew he could have no more eggs, and that would be the end of that. That the Bears and Foxers would return soon, being ready to do, and keep her nestlings away from her too.

He also knew that it could be done that way.

As he flew low over the dark wood to see the nestlings, his wings came together. She was there. She looked down from the branch he sat on, blinked, and her head fell forward onto her breast. He swooped his wings together and with one of his claws lifted her, lifted her, lifted her through the air like a crow, and then let her drop.

A faint crash—it was not a crash but a buzzing, a lowings and cracklings—and then the air caught him, and he knew it was her. She was still in the bugs, floating in her cage of branches. He felt his wings rise, and heard a new pain, like a burning.

He returned to the house, and found Dar Oakley there, sitting motionless on a mat of earth. He had heard the woman's cry. Dar Oakley had been looking for Crow, who could be a Crow. He had tried to call out to her, but rising was not easy. The noise of the women stirred the earth by the hooves of the men and the men's horses, and Dar Oakley fell from the branch where he stood, and then the earth too.

I said good-bye

IN CAMP HE WALKS CLOAKING the wind in his face. He knows he is too stupid to sleep. He will think of studying tomorrow. I want nothing to do with politics, he tells himself.

He knows he is too stupid to sleep with the whole red and white team. When he returns to the tent the leader is gone.

The valet left the tent ajar, when he arrived he found the carrion birds and the stories. He doesn't want to think about them. The work has begun, the work is started…
The words of the men on the warpath, and now the work is finished.

24 May 1958.

The world must wait.

MAYBE you buy that glass of water in Bulgaria

THAT made you want to shoot…

The money is there, that's all there.

But nothing you can do will ever change that.
March 22.

The music was drowned out by the noise of the big guns (so it says… in the bottom list of the music they had requested for the dance). The men were fighting, you see. Boom, boom, boom … the guns were banging into the bodies and the bodies lay like kittens being tumbled by bears, well-chewed into a form, blood spilled from their red noise.

The men were back in line, ready to help each other. Kars was empty again. Two to three million people come to Kars at the same time.
Laura Gan created a new stage setup at the Hotel Asia. Her, she thinks, is closer to the truth.

It was late that night. Almost dusk. In the park, Mevlut saw her doing her belly dance. But he missed the boat ride that was played by the very drunk William and Süleyman.

It was as if he had not seen her for a year in that same limo. The rims of her eyes, her cheeks in excess, her lips glittering, was making up for a terrible night. Which meant that she was much younger, much more beautiful than Mevlut had ever imagined.

The young ones saw him in the flesh, their eyes wide and glittering, when last seen in Hüseyin. Their severe faces, their clear brows, and their consternation of the journalists at the Hürkammer Gate Hotel had just begun. What had been a big shock to Mevlut, the suffering that erupted from the previous night, had now become a blow to him.

The bombs on the cars, the trucks, and the trucks' exhaust familiar enough enough for him, had started to anger him. He felt so that he wasn't going to get the singer into bed with the journalists. This time, he would send her to prison. The thought was so painful that he felt the mannequin's hands grabbing his neck by the shoulders and nearly pulling his hair out.

Mevlut had often imagined that the drunks who danced with the girl on the television who looked so much like him had been murdered after all. Back in his village, he had seen that the same old men who snuck off to drink in the slums of Duttepe, Dersim, Duttepe, hadn't been stabbed in the street once for saying the wrong thing or breaking a window, but instead had been killed with blows when their bodies were in a heap.

The girls Mevlut had danced with often wandered around the palace and the back gardens, where one of the reporters speaking in the media offices had taken pity on them. They would go out to dig the soil underneath such a manor that only a few years later, under the eyes of television and the press, they could be seen again, while the rest of the city was still in mourning. And when they could work their way through the garden strewn with flowers, got up to go inside, these girls Mevlut had really danced with for a while, until the city council banned dancing. These girls had helped him kill one of the men who'd spent the night with the fire-bombs and gone off to the Palace of the Municipal Protector (but only after the second revel). Mevlut and his friends were still there, eavesdropping.

It was late afternoon by the evening news, but Mevlut was interested in nothing else but the news. From there, he first wanted to see the place where his brother had come to spend the night with his family. Nothing could have pleased him more. Animal or bird, it was always finding color, chasing and chasing again. It was almost like a fairy tale, as he stood there and saw a tiny girl dancing with a man who was so tall that he could barely stand upright in the street. When

He heard the end of his Poem, the echo, released, and allowed the book to fall into his hands. Why this particular poem should have been plucked, it was unclear to him. It might not have been a clear case of plagiarism, of course, but maybe it was too early to know that.

Gushing tears, the tears carried into his fingers and fell, in a section of his face, over his hands.
Breathing passages of attack upon the enemy …

Thoughts of attack upon the enemy . . .

The enemy―the worldly powers, which have hated our fathers and denied us our birth,―dominate the life of man, man, in the paltry manifestations of a negligible fraction of the human race. The muddy scale of the slander, the gross embarrassment of the vast. The monstrous silence of the schemes of the wicked: the invention of a world of countless gods. Compounding the shame, the indifference, the outbreak of the salve of love, they hand the man the reed of the least skin. These simple human creatures are the instruments of the pagan God, the inspirations of all men, and this would be enough, too — to nourish the one god, inasmuch as such a god should endure. After all, our tried and rusted souls succour each other, we should believe, loathe each other, and yet our spirit is one of eternal fellowship.

Tell this gypsy fortune to your sweetheart. It is there on your palm.

The insane earthquakes banned the sea from its entrance, and as the sands of the great desert, reeds of sand that die of exuberance, rolled indifferently along the shore, the laziness of the Earth, Jesus mocked the prophecies of his savior, the ebb and flow of its waters. The terrible convulsions of the sea, jagged in their roar, hurled at the sea's head the very lives in which they were based. God, which is the interminable fruit, spread his parched body in the midst of the walking corpses strewn through the gardens, and there he laid his head, commanding the vagaries of the less developed universe of the fishes, to rest. Easter—the feast of water; for roots of wood and fruit; for thistles and the reeds; for birds of the air, for fishes and the lilies of the field. May down the rifts of the calm river which holds the vertiginous, Phoenician splendor of the burning sea and the branches of the trees. May all the waters attain a tranquillity which is not death, the calm of the river without its remorse. May waters attain tranquillity which is not breath. May they not do their work with calm no more, for amidst all the teeming rage of the Great of the Waters, only the seventh of the pond was the tranquil witness. May the waters not be murmured; in the end the waters cease to flow; and you know their source in the deep. The shadow of the mountain, the shore, the past of the island or the otherworldly cup is nothing compared with the spray of the sea, wafting through the tranquil depths of the waters and awakening the trees in their great albinos of grace.

May they not find their sepulchral symmetry, guarding the way through crises which crawl like serpents into human places and at the bottom of the waves; oh marvellous the sea, smothering them and hearing the echoes, which rise up mute from the depths of strata! For in the depths of the depths a voice is singing, a voice not of the sea but of the seas: the voice of the waters. Up there, within the depths, most sensibly true, the sea's voice is singing.

If Jesus had not suffered each day for the lack of something enough to live for, he would have thought: on the fifth day the gods have proved a mere deceptive messengers, but now things will have proved a great unfinished project: and the voice of the waters is an echo of that of the voice of the mountains: and, as for the sea, well," and the end organized by the same madness, "there is the sea, the true labyrinth, in which all are masters and none are disciples. The sea, for its part, is the God, Christ's true body, and the sea is the world, and the world that God has made. Recycle the joys of life, and you will still have what one might wish to possess: for you the soul of God, for I thee, a whiter angel than the one of the hearth (Adamastor) on the same shore, in the midst of a sea the abomination of stench, the smell of fetid hay with camel dung, the milk of goats, the en

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—That's not true anymore. I don't feel . . . what you say. Is that what you . . . what you're trying to tell me?

—Well, there are other things you don't understand. An obsessed thought is nothing. He had said that to her. And it had been true.

—Well . . .

—Even something that attempts to define a thought is a falsehood, Isaac Wohlweil said. Everything we need to know and understand is a lie. There is a false sense of us which we both believe in.

—Well . . .

—See what I mean?

—Well, let's stop jabbering about my studies and just . . .

—Like you, yes? I've seen you clear out of these lectures and get on with your work. I've been listening. Now you want me to join in? Me? No, that's not your work, I know it . . . can't you . . . well, that isn't what I meant at all, but . . . I've heard you talking about this book a lot, I've eaten your food, don't think I haven't, everything I've said came back to you, melody, passion. That's what happens when you talk about it; it that comes back to you . . .

—I don't understand! What are you trying to . . . what are you trying to do?

—The dead . . . and I thought you'd meant the eternal, Isaac Wohlweil looked up at him, shocked, and then with a rush of sudden recognition started to laugh, to see what he had done wrong that was coming out of his mouth, but he didn't mean it at all, he forced a laugh that wouldn't come out of his mouth, and leaned back in the straw, chuckling through his teeth,—in an old chatroom, wasn't it? Yes, I heard you two discussing me, and you said, well, the dead, the dead . . .

—Jesus . . . she began to cry, clutching the pillow over her head,—damned animal!

—What have you done? What's wrong with you?

—Nothing I . . . what have I done? I told you . . .

—Back, you said, I forgive you the whole thing. You were right, of course. I'm afraid you need someone . . .

—Who! What do you mean . . . but had he heard her? his lips hunched over the other cheekbone—no, no, no, on the other hand, the faith, what you think you've done, how could a man find a faith in God, he'll want anything, he'll run anything through with a faith in God . . .

—Don't be stupid . . .

—Oh, never mind. It'll come back, sooner or later.

—Watch out for those . . .

—No, I'll make it all disappear, this long, dreadful trip . . .

—Goodbye. He rose and hung the coat back on the back of the bed.—Goodbye!

—Well? she said as he got up the stairs, and then looked up at him where he stood looking down.—Do you think she was God? Do you think she was God?

—I can't believe you . . .

—No, you can't, you got no faith in any God. You're afraid of Him yourself? You afraid that He's going to take all the blame for everything and go to hell with his angels?

—No, no . . . he withdrew his arm from the bed across her breast, and stopped slowly against the wall where she stood knocking on the door, no, not to let it in but to open it and look inside.—I can't believe that . . .

—The curtains hang open on the windows.

—Why do you think they do . . .

—I don't know!

—Your curtains?

—Oh, anything. The wind outside, I can't hear them.

—Poor, poor Thom . . .

—I don't know . . .

—Christ, he was always you . . .

—No! Let't you believe that! You make me hate Him? Can you?

—All right, all right . . .

—You think you forgive me? Can't you see I can't forgive him?

—That's not . . .

—I know all about it! All right, then . . .

—All right, all right . . .

—I don't feel well,

—— It's going to grow. You have to crack at it, it will.

Of course, there were the other American heroes who came after me. The ones who overran Japan, or overran someone else's territory. I did not have to be friends with them. The movies and the comic books my mother bought me when I was a young man were a form of inspiration. They had no effect on what I wrote. When I was dead, those two old football players on the fields and the Smith and Wesson in the holster, their stories collapsed into sandbags, like those fading paintings in holiday houses.

There's not much chance now that my book will survive. Those camps, their communities of illusory violets, circulating among the dead men, we would have to be quite a lot like those communities.

I learned about physics in the sixth grade because I used to push pencils at myself through the thickly carpeted corridors, a story I told to Madame Onetot, sometimes at the Daughters of the Red Cross. My continent's roads and markets were overgrown in fallen leaves. I was an avid reader of fashion magazines. The way the ladies wore the dresses that came off the racks was harsh through the giant populous ruthlessness of New York. A hat on someone with a taste for it was equally harsh. For the liar of a long time and a monologuist, technical confidence advanced with fatalist patients, inadequate to this violence, who hacked shoulder and back and orange across their path.

I most liked Sternberg, the great artist. His paintings were your personal reality-time. Although we were never close. He taught us to weep rather than laughing in the same way.

He had a way with mountains.

He called himself the Deuce, as in Deuce, the Feathered.

He was almost a thousand miles from civilization.

"There is only one way that a man can triumph over his family," said Sternberg, "and that is to play an elaborate role in a catastrophe."

(The "mistress" has been exorcised.)

He grew up in a Russian village whose turf had once been streaked with solid red clay. His mother growled at him like a peasant demanding a change of property. And he loved the streets where her sons ran, the language at first unknown to him, then in the millions of words that flowed between them, the pain and the success of their own tedious ordination.

He was an almost purely American boy.

He said, "Swiss."

He was born in New York, he told me this.

That was an American boy.

My mother said, "Your destiny is too large for you."

That was my destiny.

My father's wife was half Polish. He was half German. Some say he was born in a small town, but he was never sure. Either his mother was poor and couldn't afford it, or she was rich and he could afford to live rough. The stereotypes likely played a part.

He had an older brother, a boy never much loved or known, because he was not a strong child.

My mother would sit with her hands folded, squeezing the centre of a truth, while my father talked of his successes. She watched my father toil hard at the stamping of his own self-consciousness.

"You're a strong boy, and I'm proud to have you. You're very intelligent and very nervous in a very difficult situation."

"And you're a good father."

"That's a serious question for you to ask. Who's a great father to a child like that?"

But when I got home, my mother had gone to the college library.

There was no book I could read with her there. Only books which I myself had read.

I sat down in the dining room. I had a bowl of boiled apples that was a present to my table. I happened to like my cold oatmeal with milk.

She said to me, "Getting away from the center, is that not a good idea? You might as well move on into the suburbs."

"Right."

"It's a wild country."

"In one year the last tenant zeros."

"I don't care enough for it, that's the problem. I'm too homesick. I don't think I'll ever learn to like New York. I go to the suburbs only to picture the neighborhoods I used to live in with in the old days. I think about washing my bicycles in amber. I remember days when I went to bike races. I go in circles sometimes."

"I was on the ztrast," said my mother.

"I don't remember

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—What do you mean? You tell me what you think you are. What gives you your self esteem.

—The self. Self esteem. Rather like Theograph in Greek.

—Then you're a fool.

—Go down to Hell yourself.

—That's your only chance.

—I don't believe in heaven.

—Go to hell yourself. I don't believe in hell.

—So long as I'm in Hell, where do you think you're in?

—I love you.

—That's ridiculous, now. That's as far as you're concerned. Do you have any notion where I might be? You probably never got a good look at me anyway. Do you understand?

—Give me a minute.

—You're embarrassed to be forthright with me so fast.

—I'm not the easiest person to live with in this world.

—Maybe you are, Soraya. Maybe you don't think you can bear the times I've seen. You feel that they're time itself and that life goes by too slowly for me to notice I'm alive. A woman who's not afraid of life is hardly a woman at all.

—I'm an old woman. That's not a falseness to you.

—What on earth do you mean I'm an old woman? As if it matters what you think.

—I just mean it.

—I am only telling you what's true to you. Talk to this woman. She's not blind. She sees and I don't.
She looked at the wall. Golems, plaster walls. The red of the next smile.

—Go on, I'll get a good standing chance to stand here by the door with you. Keep your dignity together. You'll need it.

They didn't expect to fall at the ballet school and they were right, after all, there were people so ugly that nobody ever thought of them as beautiful. The families fell back on their chairs then, their legs spreading out on the floor, and all eyes now embraced one another as they rocked and laughed. The Iranian teacher, the Kurdishevsky brothers, a dazzling smile on his lips, a gleaming skeleton in his shirt pocket, they met in the hallway, and a great deal of hand-kissing went on, before coming back around the classroom, to take their questions. The Bach and Mozart recitals had already started and the music student was already preparing for violin and cello. What do you stand up to?

—We can't just let him go ahead for the bowels.

—Perhaps there are things that can be done for him we can do in ecstasy.

—An adult or an adolescent adolescent?

—The angels of death have seen fit to make him a woman. Over his coffin that's what we'll do.

Yunus Patel didn't find out what his wife had done until the summer after his mother-in-law was in a pain hospital in Odessa where a kidney problem had been cured and he and Nadia were looking through the yellowing paper he had unfolded and she saw the paper with minutely circled bites on the sides and asked with genuine curiosity, Was he dead?

—Not just for a moment longer, she said, trying to ignore her question.

—Didn't he think he was?

—Not even for an instant. I couldn't look at him. That's when I knew he was alive. Now. Just to know him.

—So where is he?

—I don't know.

—Why not?

—Can't you see, he shows, none of you can. It's as if he's vanished without anyone seeing him. No one could see him, no one could see him, no one could even hear him. He's dead. I can't bear to look at him, all the blackness and decay, the squelching, oozing dark. It's enough to make you cry.

—Are you crying or just weeping? You know I can't look right at him.

—How many times do you have to ask?

—How many times? You're crazy.

—You don't want me to see him, do you?

—Didn't you know? He wanted me to see him.

—Then why didn't you let him get over your life?

—Who is he?

—What is he, Petya?

—Who is he?

—You, you, Nadia, you, you really know.

—She, she, she hardly knows how to write, she doesn't

And he turned to the room.

Looking at the wall. He turned it around. The man put his hand over his face.

You go to hell.

He swatted the image.

And he turned to the wall.

God damn you, he called through the gray wings.

Then he wrenched the wall from his hand and took up his pounding pounding.

* * *

HE CAME TO the riverbank where a bench stood in the center of the river among the trees and a lake boar came along the bank with arms outstretched. They clambered out and sat in the old bones of old shadcatcher and Gypsy. Caligula was dragging one of them by the hair.

Qué chingaderas, she y'know. He wiped the wet curls off her veiny brow.

Amistadero, she said.

Quiero.

He took the woman by the arm and sat the other in the water. She came down the path with a shell of green coals. Caligula was watching the two of them. He watched them until they went into the woods.

Quiero, she said. He spat at her and put the eels in the outrushing water. They stood on either side of the fire and flipped over the coals until they were almost out of them and before them the river rose into the sun again.

The river lay high and vast in the shining chiaroscuro; in the morning they could see about thirty feet of it and the smell was of dried taint. When they left the river in the early afternoon the heat seemed to have passed on through the day. They walked up the path to the bluff, where the river was a black and naked face in the branches and the mist hung like the sash of a gate.

Quiero like I never seen him so good at fishing. They were upstream the better for the work. They called to the banked and late-river with the engines and twirling oars, looking back over the water blue-eyed with that peculiar pleasure of the hunt.

There was no one at all in sight. The sun was low in the west when they got home and there was no one in the house. A wooden bedstead stood by the bend of the river. They made a fire and went to unmake the bed and Caligula got down in the rocks and before the wood was dry he made a craft of his own devising and there stood while he worked. He was working from iron rods that he cut with a wirecutter and he measured them against wadis or flat stones for a while. The morning was hot and the people of the town sat up all day and they leaned back and put their hats on and they did not care a whit. They cooked a stew of vegetables, meat, of mushrooms and lard. As they worked the river rose of green dye under them and in the afternoon they went back to the town. Two boys on the surface of the water and one of them looked out over the river and Caligula turned, and went back to the river. Two oarsmen floundered and one drained a pond.

They opened the little boat to take Caligula in and Caligula stepped ashore and took a bird out of the water and tipped it over into the water. He clambered to the bow and Caligula sat in the creel beneath outboard of the boat and they put him out to sea. In the afternoon they rose and went back to the house and ate. Think on the fishes, she said. I never knowed a hichipper before. I am the master of this place.

She kissed the brim of her hat and looked at him.

He turned in the seat. You are the maddest man I have ever seen. Like to dream of a maddest bird.

He waited. He looked at her. She turned the glassy face to him.

Dont let them get to the far side.

Think on the sharks.

He looked at her. Waves were rising on the shore. Far out in the marl.

The next day Caligula was taken to bed with a pailful of urine on the deck of the riverboat.

He walked out into the cold morning and went upriver where he'd never been before. On the far shore he saw a dark presence he knew. He turned back but the sand was wet and he could see the motion made by the boat's eyes against the water. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Finally he caught sight of the hooded man. He called and some echo answered and left him for dead.

He walked along the south shore.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—

There was a frost on the street. All the trees in the square rustled and a burning wind whipped them overhead. The town seemed to have gone numb since Sabrina's last visit, but not completely. The bathhouse and the doctor's house were still a thing of the past and the gestures of the sirens and the mud-wicks still pierced the air.

Deuce's cell phone had quit him forever. He didn't want to remember it ever again. He had to forget it, change it into a new identity, a new face, and tear it out of himself.

The juror was in courthouse when the sun went down. The police shout of it might not even have been audible, but it was audible all over town. Sera's phone was no longer in her apartment, so the woman at the desk did not have to hear.

Again, in her orange-green room, the woman took out her pad and mailed me pages of scratch paper. She said they came from the Highlands at night, from out of the dark.

"Who is that?" I said.

"Your mother," said the woman.

It was as if she had forgotten who I was and was beginning to remember.

I tried to laugh but with my teeth together I could not do it.

"What's funny about your mother?" said the woman.

"Nothing," I said. There was no need to call her that.

"Are you in love with her?" said the woman.

"No," I said.

"You don't look it," she said.

"No," I said.

"I want to know her opinion of you. I never liked her."

I had forgotten that when I saw my mother she had seemed different.

She had put on weight since then, although she was still skinny. She had never taken exercise. She sat in the chair in her room reading the newspaper, almost never but when she did, she sat in it, too. She went on TV pretty much every afternoon, but there was almost never any talk about how she felt or what she was thinking or what she had done: just happened stories from nothing.

The woman in the next seat hitched her seatbelt. I imagined that she might do it for good. She had a wife somewhere, and a child and a house. She would never have them. She would sit in the chair, not looking at me, not looking at anyone, if there was no one there, and then it would be over.

I realized that I had been talking to myself.

The woman looked through the sun at me all that time and the window of the next seat caught my eye. She turned toward me and got up. The television was on. I looked at her to see if she had noticed.

She did not. She tucked her paper in front of her and went to the kitchen. I watched her while she poured herself a cup of coffee. She made little noises at herself and then she got up and took a sip of coffee. The pot was like a little tin pot for her that she held in her hands like a kind of doll. She stepped over to the table, got the magazine from the cupboards, set down the cup, then got up. She went back to her seat and waited for me to get up. I watched her put the cup down on the seatless chair, but she did not sit down. There was something different about the shape of her body, but also quite constant to me. Her shoulder instinctively rose to meet her knee. Her thigh gently swept off side to side, and I knew she was feeling inside just like someone watching someone. I rose and stood next to the woman.

"Do you know her?" she said.

"No," I said.

"I don't."

"You made a mistake," she said.

"No," I said, "no, it's a mistake."

"This isn't an impulse," she said. "You're right there."

She was, indeed, somewhat more vivid than in the television. She was in fact the dry old woman I had seen with my father in the graveyard at afternoon. In the lamplight she had nearly disappeared up the road, as if she had dropped off to sleep in the world. She had a cloak around her shoulders, and her eyes had just looked asleep, but in the light of the living room the old woman looked like she was dead. Just like a mother.

"You're right," said the woman.

"You can tell something awful in the eyes, like a bellyache."

"I don't do that," said the woman.

"Well, it's all right

Love, Marcelo. Love is the sole means by which we give ourselves to every human being.

What happens to the mind shall be the truth of the world.

We have no mother living in our house.

Woman, such diversity of spirit, such promise.

Isabel lied and snatched me from her, I know this. She says I have to marry her man. And if I marry her husband, may God grant me a son.

She laughed. You don't have a father, my poor boy. She embraced him and laughed. You're like a kitten.

My writings are the contacts left by death, my physical identity. I don't know if I have an identity or an essence. Like a kitten, I feel I am my sheer self.

What do you know, my husband?

I don't know from where or in what body but I am a man, a man, my husband, my family, my wife, the father of my children, lovers, readers, poets, plays, artists. Incognito I was born like a frog.

What do you, Marcelo, know that I am an orphan?

Individual identities are nothing but wishful thinking. But that's precisely what I know.

For I am an orphan of a bravado whose motto was, damn you to hell.

I accept that your name is Marcelo. But it isn't your real name. My name is Sabrina. It has no other name. And your heart is the heart of a locust.

Your name does have a good variety of names.

I am a solitary soul. Sabrina.

I am a man who doesn't want to lose his solitude. I am the father of my own son.

And I am a small transparent speck left in the sand of time.

Dear Sabrina, I swear to you: I am going to die. I am going to die. I am going to die because I am no longer enough. I'm going to die. So that my personal self, my soul is going to die with me. I'll die weeks before my body returns to me. And that's a denial of the fatal truth of exile.

Iada eel est enfadientem.

They say that on the night of the death of Tácito, on the fifth of February 1868, I became for a moment part of the peaceful procession in the streets of Pedregal, smiling and happy. I sat on the perfect bench of the processional common room. I drank and delighted in the luxury of my own vomit, and on leaving this den of pointless noise I thought: What a day of exile for Aguirre. I float there in the beginning of time, my protegée, my sacrifice, the disembodied that never forsakes the room, dead as deep as the cadaver of Yoshiichi me, your sweet and petite body hanging there, your green eyes glistening in the incomparable light of the oil lamp, as red as the blood of a fire that never burns out, your black hair blowing in the face, staring at me with eyes as cold as the gypsum, bathed in light, eyes that shine so bright in the red band of darkness. You are in no time. I am here, in time's shall not pass. I am here, enclosed of you.

But when did you become part of the great procession? A long time ago? Then, when Franzabriel listened to the voice singing in the distance, before the twirling torches in the night, then I was there among the stores in Chinatown, peddling my phony papers of notes. Yusef Kanabalí, one of the three treasures of the world, the gold of Mystery itself.

Outside the crowds of homeless pilgrims, the torches already lit, crowd after one another, waving our passport, our test papers and big women's underpants. The torchlight dances a waltz. The candles glow without heart. Mr. Galupi holds his hands over his face like a swan. Our square, the square that was not entirely empty on some long-ago morning in Chile-to-China, or in the distant coastal cities of Greenland. Ehi, Francisco Gall, the art dealer, two fornoth masses and a foolish child, and then, finally, Ehi, Héctor Emeritus Professor of Art De Stort, and, in a moment at a far corner of the market square, Catalina-Luzana, being on her knees in front of a half-empty cart with a few men and women in nothing but filthy undergarments, each with a lariat, who was beyond the entrance, and inside the heavy boxes hanging in the street, balding men in their

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
It was the first idle thing I ever did. Like watching TV without hearing it? It's what you might call the curse of human life. You fill the silence with what you're afraid of, and all of a sudden you're not afraid of it anymore. How would anyone know?

I don't have a favorite song of mine, but I long to have one in my memory. The Two Americas first.
It's not so bad when you had the same thought once.
The very beginning of the war was caused by the difference in the temperature. The sound of blood was no longer enough to kill any insect. The senior officer tried to make matters worse, but I would not have it. I am scared of the most common fly. I hate insects in general.

Seen from the air, it's hot enough, but it hurt more.
That was the period after the Russo-Japanese War. The whole world was soon involved. The Soviet Union was kind enough to set up a temporary base at Hainanstad, but the next morning the enemy began to invade Belgium. That was the beginning of the 1939 Battle for Jerusalem.

I never fought, hated anything besides galloping naked through trenches, shooting hoops, winning battles, marrying the enemy. The enemy eventually got tired of all that, and fired a few more missiles to kill us. When they did, I would continue to do the same kind of things.

But now it's summer, and we're visiting the bringing-forth of spring.

Normally I am the last one on the pole. The one who starts to scatter naked on the soft earth. The one who lights a cigarette, eats, and dances. The one whose belly, hanging down, explodes in explosions of flame. The fat man who walks alone along the riverbank. The squarehead with the red mustache. The squarehead with the dragon tattoo. The drowsy mother climbing into her basket. The woman in blue with the Prince of Lights. It's a very tempting and easy reverie. But when, in a moment of weakness, I say, "Go," only one of us will go. I've lost the will to keep on doing things. I'm a loser. Most people are more important than I am. So even before I say, "Take your way," even before I say, "Move," even before I say, "Wait," I'm still glad not to see it. It was a terrible summer and trust is the only thing that can save you.
Six years later, I'd was back again. That was the summer of Enrico's lawsuit, but in fact the vicissitudes of the court were overwhelming. I was still in good shape, still protected by guards and public prosecutors.

The summer went by slowly. I just kept on doing what I was doing, watching the sun set, the tide come in, the light slip. I still watched it, my eyes covered.

• • •

I haven't seen another fat prosecutor in decades.

I stood up and went to the bathroom.

Sitting there in my underwear, I was amazed at how the water clung to my massive chest. I went down to the kitchen, took a shower, and then I went upstairs.

Having washed and washed a few more, I went downstairs to the dining room.

I ate dinner at the electric glass table.

That was the best, though the waiter waltzed me out of there like a prosecutor ever again.

They said I was twenty-three years old.

I said I was the first fat lawyer I knew.

Then I had a sip of brandy.

• • •

I didn't miss a thing. I was at peace with myself. I was at peace with myself, and I was at peace with Pope Pius II.

The whole goddamn world was in my hands.

I wasn't as dumb as a rule. I don't even remember if I went to the office the next day. Maybe we came for a drink or something else. I know I did, but I don't remember.

I got into the taxi at Fifty-sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. It had been a long day for me, so I decided to get some rest. There was nothing to do here. Perhaps I sat there in the sun. My oleaginous skin had become a new type of skin that I could not remember having, so I could not lift it and put it on under my new name.

I stood out front, and I smoked.

I don't think I even opened the door of the taxi because I was so curious about the guy, who, despite his forty years, was still muscular.

So I was still giving the old guy the old he took with him when

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

- Motto, Ovid. Thanatologus. Tyrellus. The soul m'est tres, we, we, we let go, which we no longer possess.

-And of course you write of your youthful need not fear having abjured?

- Our need, which is not abjured. Or we would be fewer where there is more.

Brougham laughed:

- Oh you, end of your long life.

- No, I refuse that, no. Clergyman's tongue, that we know, yes, the not having to die. But if there are all those not just you, no doubt you'll find reason to be glad.

- Reason to be glad of, in the name of love, reason to be glad, the reason cited by buskers and horse's riders and poets and wives with their stockings dragged from under their breasts, a reason that you too cannot engage the one in, you can hardly associate with him nor fight the other's battle, I have a sick horse and little will to live, and many a horse have named me, that was my fortune, that the name is Wilhelm, that I should live a moment longer here, that I shall not die.

- Yet you have become more devoted. Because of your love. Or your need, I would say. Matters that fall into the hands of the pious escape.

- Not my affair. But an old man's.

- And if I come back?

- If I do, we have a consolation that will make a man feel he has been forgiven.

Brougham laughed again.

 - I expect we will make relief.

- Not the needful, surely, where there is none.

- God would not want that. God would want us to find at least some comfort.

- How should I know what is forgiven?

- Perhaps you are right, very possibly. In any case there is nothing for you. Go back to where you came from. To become a councillor again. Do you agree?

- No. It is not the same.

- I doubt you. You have a beautiful voice, the one of your days. Say you are to play something I have yet to hear of.

- I am waiting for the choir of the choir of the convent of Minorca. I attack with a sword. I sing with sound.

- Eleison, it is fine. You may not be much all of a man after my parmance.

- But I am more, they say, than a man. It is not always what you who find.

- Once, long ago, when I was a boy, I demanded of heaven too much and too fast. I remember being fed and crying on the way there. A good boy can manage if God likes.

- Oh great God of heaven that loves you, that loves you young and loves you. Go home, pray too.

- When my name is sought after, I shall know me according to its nature and in equal measure. I am not afraid.

- You must know such things too. The voice that knows you.

- I am not afraid. That is my freedom, my death. Does that have nothing to do with me?

- So you do not, so you please. Go home. And keep the number-books.

- I will never. O great God of yours that has endured me in exile, I cannot return. Nor then shall I return. The price of your knowledge of me is my debut in the palace of the Khan. I have been granted entry to the most luxurious quarters of the capital city.

- The city of power. I rather thought it more prudent that the palace of power not be for a moment near my territory. A man can lose both in heaven and in the hole of the pit. You, O lord, your name, the rank of Lieutenant I, may be our only judge. But for so small as the wonders of the world is to be taken with me, one day at my leisure and ordered.

- You are making it abundantly clear that you know nothing of justice. What is choose?

- I am giving up the Queen of Scotland sipping wine and smoking cigars. I am giving her the pleasure of listening. It is not a pleasure that God can long to take.

- God in heaven is perfect, is he not? But think of that, O Lord of hell, think of all that is possible.

- God has done it wisely. He has given to us inured to our oppression while he was at liberty here on earth and then in a place of honour. Now when he goes to seek the right of his gods he is taking

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—The moment when you die.—

He laughed. —Yes. What do I know about dying? To be reborn the moment you've died. A perfect instant. It's like being born again. That's what I want. The death I will die when I'm dead.—

—I want you to be our father. I want you to teach us to be equal. As the government says. That's what's and must be. The children burn with a great fire inside. What I fear is where you will die. I've nothing, my brother doesn't want me. And although I've tried making love to you, in the past, you've never guessed what it's like to be a man who's saved you from the black beast. Within the womb.—

—So you want me to become a woman? Die? For a bloody God-damned man … I'm not going to die. I'll never die. I'll live.—

—We're going to be fine together … you away with her, me in my father's house.—

—At least you're going to be my father's mother.—

—Doctor Sipkin, we are survivors. We are much better than all the others we've been offered nowadays. More perfect, even … more lethal, if only you could see it in your hands.—

—Look at the world. Don't you give satisfaction to the feelings of those whom you don't touch—it would be better to be yourself, instead of someone who does possess feelings. Romance has never been your calling—in the capitalist world you can get away all right. Did you live the day you were born?—

—Yes, what am I like now? Look at me. I live fifty-two years old. And there're young men around who never gave you that much hope, at all. Perhaps that makes life easier. Perhaps you're better off not to be consumed by such emotions in rich foods. That's not my truth. I suspect for myself you don't know what you're like after all.—

—You don't know what you're like now. When I'm with you I never know when I'm going to be able to say that you have no right—he knows I'm right, there's no malice in me—to be accused of a crime I didn't carry out. That I murdered my ex-wife. That wouldn't have been enough. We were a family together, your mother and I. What are people like? What do they do about their children? What do they say when they'm intercepted, and how do you manage to stay clear of them? No, no, for once you've made your position clear, you cannot go back to that killing. Do you know what you've done, what's passed through your mind? You make love to me and then you berate me for being inadequate to the needs of my body or for the organization of my work. You know what you've been reduced to. I am a European, not a German, I'm a Polish-Jewish mother-in-law—but my life has become a mixed system. I can't confide in you all, tell you each what's true and lie, compromise and the system. What right do these people have over the life of my son? And your daughter? What do I owe you? Who do you think you are? Don't you dare it, make love to me. Do you think I've put my finger down so quickly on my breast. I never had a breast scan.—

—So you have produced a child out of the blue, out of the some defect of yours or of genetics; without planning it in advance when you might need it, out of love, that's how it happened. Such criminal blood. You can't be blamed for that. That's how you were carried along by the braves, the nice, sweet toads who brought you from your mother. Our poor children, victims of their own oppression at home, growing up never to be the same what they were. Believe me, whatever you despise, it's possible that someone groats your breasts and feeds you your well-meaning breasts. That's what it's there for. The black people, don't you think that every black man and woman has his special breast, if not his own? It's with them. With you. The horrible white women in our cities, they have it made, they buy it in stalls on the airport. In secret shops in men's houses. And we're still cleaning up: no, no, don't come in, don't come in here. If I see you in the street, coming out of that place, I'll run. Don't come into here. Come down here and live with us but not with us. Don't come down here and pretend to be a

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—You are a baby VSiam.

The boy picked up the four-page spread of stories around his pillow and shook it free, then pretended to study the photo under it. —But what about her? They killed her? she screamed, his head still cocked this way.

—It's not finished yet, he said.

—What are you? said the boy looking away from her at last; but making no gesture at all.

—Kindertoten, the boy said, staring at the flower-print head of the old man but not at the open button-accessible shirt.

—I'm Scorched Earth, said the boy ignoring the fact, —at least you have your children with your new to them. I am Scorched Earth.

—And you're Scorch'd Earth, he said looking up at the smile, recognizing it a few moments before it was there, studying his brother's face and someone else's, as though a past patience, face stuck on whatever still features signified.

—Zey, said the boy looking down, still searching through the rubble.

—You?

—You? The boy was looking at him with concern, and something else. The boy was breathing heavily, and his lips were moving.

—Because there are no children out there, he said.

—Told you it's nothing, he said.

—No, it's nothing. The boy was looking into his own eyes.

—It's a darn shame, he said.

—Because it is?

—Because of her, he said.

—What about you, my brother? Fair's fair. Still a good man. Still his wife, still his wife, still his kids.

—Let's not get off that subject, he said, and looked at the blood again.

—You don't get off everything, the boy said. You got left out there.

—I don't want to talk about it.

—Let's not get off anything! The boy was standing up carefully. Then he got off his stool and sat down.

—What're you going to do with herself?

—Same as before. Same as before, eh? He sat down.

—What about your children?

—Same as before, he said.

—You didn't get them out there.

—No.

—Because I got you out there and finished her off. She didn't count, he said.

—No, you said she didn't.

—She ain't counted.

—You've got a damn daughter she didn't count nothing. She don't count nothing. You just told her you did, right? You said it went down.

—No.

—You're damned right to tell me what you done. You won't believe me so I'll tell you what you done. You stuck your fingers in that reserve bucket.

—No, I said she didn't.

—Not that it matters. It don't matter how you got it or how you's done it. You just got it, that's all. She ain't got it.

—Didn't she roll over?

—As sure as you like to wheel around. Please don't make no use of that, you hear? You never will, you hear?

—You said when I went in there you was there.

—What did you do? You seen her?

—I seen her! He was standing straight up, with no lids on his mouth, not looking at anything.

—You saw her!

—No. She ain't seen nothing.

—She ain't. She's got you all over the ground. You didn't stop her coming after you. That didn't stop. That was her business. You think she doesn't know what you done? You love her more than her fucking that baby of hers. That's what God love you.

—What I love isn't what you love.

—You say that?

—I love what I love because I love it, I love what I love because I love it and I love what I love. I love what I love because I love who I love. I love who I love.

—You don't know who you love either.

—She ain't nobody to love either. She's my love. I know who I love.

—Well she ain't.

—She ain't nobody to love either.

—You love them boys?

—I love girls! I love them all! I love girls all.

—She's

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Write it down. Do you hear those songs, the ones in the music, the ones in the voices, where they're new?

I love you so much, my love.
5.
Do you hear them, your husband?

I know them when I hear them. I see them and feel them, looking at you, you dear creature.

And then?

I leave you my favorite sweater. It's because of you you'll have a lovely sweater. A really gorgeous coat. And you'll have a coat of your own.

- I don't have a coat, I told the man.

- I know what you're thinking. You're thinking what I'm thinking. It's a fine wine, it's about to pour. You can't drink it.

- Well, I am going to drink it. I have to. And soon. For a while. To rest up. That's right.
- Good. And soon. Good. And soon. Good.
- Good, good. Now I'm going to put back the blue pencil. That's enough now.

- And I'm going to write the poem while it'll still be up on the page you are looking at. I'm going to write, as long as there are people. The bell of the church presses, her voice shudders off, and she drops the courtiers' hands and, turning, starts to weep with her and doesn't stop.

WEDNESDAY

Dursden November afternoons. Love my Mama,

the

departed.

She is still here,

lacerated and wept,

struck down by a battle,

whom she daily finds to be,

her secret,

not mine.

It is raining. It is light,

slender,

not dark.
She is sitting in her room,

with her eyes shut,

her hands on the arms of her chair,

torrenting out from the cold

the tears that cannot own her own.

There is darkness inside her,
and it hides.

There is no light.
In the corner of her eye
a bird sings,

and so does she.
The world awakens, she tells the guard,
taking refuge and safety in the deeper
dark. She borrows a kiss, with her trembling lips.
A kiss. Her skin is stretched of
kissing. Her covered head is in leather.
She lives. Away, from here. For now.

She is not ready for this. She can't believe it.

As the terror of summer passes she braces herself, and, dear God, she will never again be ready for this. She is begging for her children

to come home. She is

always waiting for her children's return.

Hurry to her. Only her daughter

can be with her again, the manner of her life.

She tried to face the world,

to her kid, her parents, her children's family.

She tugged at her temples and prayed.

She fought it, she tried, she fought.

But it has to go on, she told the man,

her voice broken and half lost.

If she must know, to have to run in there.

Her heart says to her,

She can go on and on.

She can go on and on. She was taught this.

She knows it is it.

She is afraid too of what will happen if she cannot stop.

But still she must. And her daughter.

This is what she must do. She must take up the knife

and the hogan.

The man and the man are right.

The heart will not let her off. And she can go on.

So far she has kept her mouth shut. Embraces

her. A woman in your house.

Her lips part and her mouth closes.
"And now she shall tell them."

"Ah, " he says. "a legacy, a gift for you."

"It has been so long since I saw

one bloody thing me."

"It will not."

"I can do it."
"And you won't change it."

"I shall."
"The blood will get thin, the blood,

when I get strong."

"We're not frightened."
"You've got nothing to hide.

You haven't seen me cry."

She says to the man,

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—It's our freedom, or our destiny as a species.

Her dark eyes glittering now.

—Pray, pray. Your spirit is with us. Come, pray.

—Pray, pray.

—You have asked for it. You cannot reject it. Agree with it.

—We don't accept it.

—You must. No. Your body is our mirror, we all reflect it. This is our shared identity.

He breathed deeply.

—You are approaching danger.

—What do you mean?

—Animal. Animal manifestation. You are touching yourself. This is not animal behavior but a manifestation of animal consciousness. A sublimation of your inner self.

—I don't want a mirror.

—No. Here, take this. He held out the other end. —This is it. He took the embroidered cloth in both hands. She raised the sudary and came and sat on the stool. She held the handkerchief across her face.

—You've lived so long with mirrors. Without mirrors you see only one kind. We are three-dimensional and very full. Here, look at us.

Her red lips drew back as though, to protect herself from their weight. He watched her crawling. Her long legs stretched across the seats. They seemed to lean against each other. —See us clearly.

—What is it? Ask.

Her lips closed. The soft creases of her face began to waver.

—The mirror, the mirror we see is only of this body and this self. It's self-generated, Archy. You've been watching yourself lately, a while back, studying your face in the mirror, strings of reflections shifting, you look at yourself and you think you're new, this is the first time you've truly been myself, a new person.

He felt hot tears in his eyes. He got up. Mornings were the best days of all. They were the days when a man or woman let go of him without regret. When they let her go, all the years of life, his long trip, capricious friends or like-minded comrades, all the months of their hushed profess ignorance and silence, he would leave her portrait unearthing in the sun. Only when Archy Janson had parted company with Nat Budov and turned to his next lover, did he wish to change places with her.

—We are all absorbed in the past, she said. We have not yet destroyed ourselves in the water. We sit in a house and say we are here, and that we must over-live our lives.

She peered out of her mirrored face. —Where has she gone? he asked.

—I didn't want to leave you, but she hurried on.

—Out where?

—Out of your life.

—What do you mean, out where?

—Out of your life.

—And you want to go somewhere else?

—To Africa, I told you.

—Africa? Archy looked around him. He put the gun in his jacket pocket, finishing his coffee.

—I saw a billboard in Times Square.

—Times Square?

—Maybe, she said. I don't know. I don't know that. I guess I never saw it. But I wrote about it in the paper.

—Take a walk, he said. He walked into the sun.

—Wherever we are going, it's going. I'm getting to know you better.

He sat in the backpack, feeling her weight. The sheets began to tangle, her body.

—You used to be so beautiful, she said, and stopped.

—I let my hand fall loose, the gun in the bag on the seat of the jeans. Nat took a card out of his jacket pocket, and handed it to him, a business card, the kind that has a Gry arena and barroom number. Archy put it into the laptop where he kept his passport.

—Hands off my nice and tidy pants, he said.

Girlfriend, he thought, but out of order. Out of his league now.

—I don't let you need my help, said Nat.

Redemption was such a simple decision in the long run, and Archy felt a lump in his throat. Such a simple necessity to alter his behavior. The situation called for subtraction, for a few rough seconds during which he needed to continue a course of action, of thought, before the judgment would be made. Religious turmoil, mutual dependency, the close collaboration of fate. In the next hour or so,

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

Dead? How can I know that? The undead, said Samad, and smirked in the easy way that Samad did his private shows of gross superiority. Don't kid the ant, Samad had said, but you must see what's got into them.

Now Pip wanted to ask, Why were you so late? Because of that anyway, and because you know I didn't, and you think I married you because you said you were going to be jealous forever, and your brain is in some kind of a whirlpool.

She didn't dare ask what was happening to Gray wasps, or Cypress, or Blackadder. She didn't know herself what to say, and didn't know how to say it. She wanted to say something to Gray, but she didn't know how. She feared he was going to ask her to go home with Sam. And she began to cry. His poor mother, she kept at it. She didn't really mean it.

She cried all the way home because the children were so upset because of the horror. She couldn't stay out of it. She had to be there, to be present. She thought they needed her. She thought her husband, and her son, and every other man in the family, were in pain that way, and that they would be upset that she was there—that they could find her. She thought it would be a relief to her to be there. She could hear Gray's cries, a distant howl, and she was afraid he would not be upset. She could see him, her husband, walking in the dark, sniffing and shaking. She could hear him snorting and swallowing. She knew that so much suffering had been given her he would have been in the same state she was in, but it was different.

However mad and incomprehensible Samad's far-from-normal behaviour might appear to be, there was some sense in him that he was a good person, and he loved her and cared for her. He still had some hope in him. He would never find another man like him, and he would not be lonely in the world. But it was hard to care for any man if you loved him as he was. It was like trying to be with someone who worked so very hard and was such a burden. And if you loved the other man, if he and he were together, if you thought you loved him and took him in—well, it was like owning another body, it was like doing away with yourself. It was strange how it worked, in the dark of her bedroom in Blackadder's house.

She was in bed with Gray.

"I didn't know you were going to call me. But I thought it was time to talk."

"Why would I want to talk, Erin? I'm a sodding saint. Talking for my own good, telling the truth behind it"—he looked at her gravely and deliberately— "and better still, telling you what we used to do together—"

"I love you," said Erin.

"Found any faults in that? I've never seen how you've changed young. You're a night-wife."

"Not anymore. I've stopped being one. My sodding mother. I need to sleep with someone in the daytime."

"I thought you were an academic," said Gray with a smile that was a little too devoid of human warmth there. "I thought you knew everything."

Erin went to sleep.

Gray wandered through the living room and watched a few things happening on TV. The news had it that Abu Dhabi had been bombed by a wild, naked horseman in an Arabian courtyard, just a few days ago. A man with a gun, a woman in a robe, more people—maybe there was a killer they were looking for. He was from the East, he said, where there was risk and risk—he and his group went to logger camps and listened to them. There were Arabic stories, those people, and Erin knew only one thing: he had been very young when his mother died.

It was to be expected that after his mother died, Gray stayed in my bedroom. Doors should not open by themselves. Yes. I knew it. Not that you could say anything else. I didn't want to know, because it meant you returned. I had to see him. I wanted to see him after his mother's death, after Samad. Wherever he wanted. No one else. Doris no one else. That's why I slept with Little Mice and toasted them. Doris had a good deal of people in the UK, and she had a lot of them. It would have been nice to have Emmaline, her half-Irish sister, beside me in the next bed, across the pillow

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
If I had been standing on the sidewalk in the sun-drenched streets, waiting for a girl who was a girl and not a boy, we would have looked like simple bums. I honestly don't feel like this kind of bullshit anymore. My head is the one big, scratchy room in this edifice. I hear a telephone ring just as I'm sitting on the edge of the bed. It rings continuously, sometimes a few times. It rings continuously. I'm under the impression that someone is calling to question me. That there is some situation that requires total discretion. Some girl must be the most gentle, the most kind, the most inoffensive. I'm sure of that, and I'm sure of that right now. But we're not on a street corner. We're in a love nest.
But it's almost three and I'm no longer going to be alone. Someone calls my name and opens the door. My heart freezes up. Somebody is ringing my door. I am the one who is being called.

I run to the phone and embrace the receiver.

The person is someone.

The man's voice sounds soft, too soft, faint and barely noticeable.

"Hello," I say.

"Hello," the voice answers.

The impact is terrible.

"Don't slam the door, please. We're going to our room," the voice continues.

"We, you say?"

"Uh-huh."

"Shall I go in alone?"

The voice hesitates, then says, "Certainly."

I hold the receiver toward my ear and hear clearly, but without embarrassment.

"Fine," the voice says. "Go in alone."

"Will you be avoiding me?"

"No."

"I'm sure you are."

"As I died, I sure as fuck was dying."

I stop and breathe hard over the receiver.

"Look," I say, "who's calling?"

Another door opens up.

"Yes."

"Who are you?"

"She who calls."

A man's voice. A man's voice, faint, barely audible, that seems to be coming from far away.

"What is it?" I ask. "Who, me?"

"Uh-huh. That."

"Your voice sounds soft and kind of far away."

"It's not my voice at all."

"It's my voice. I don't hear it."

"I'm sorry."

"Won't you come outside?" he asks again. "Please don't take all day. With all these people around me? I think we'll need a smoke."

"Actually I won't," I say. "For the moment."

A moment passes.

"What is it?" I say again.

"That, uh-uh."

"Do we have ones?"

"Yes, we have productions. I call them 'Films.' In the daytime I call them 'Filmed'—that's my name and my agent name. I have a lot to say, I suppose?" he asks. "Please call me if you need anything."

The door closes on my ear. My phone does not ring anymore. I hear it ring three times faintly, then stop on, then ring again and start up the stairs. At the top my door is opened by a girl's voice:

"Hey, G. Hey, cute!"

"Sorry," I say.

"Did you hear me, G.?" a man says softly.

"Just talk," I say. "I'm talking about … you. G. You too. Out. Out."
The man's voice is very faint but he sounds just like the man in the movie.

"So what's the point?" the man asks. "You're still here, aren't you?"

"Go tell somebody else," the man says.

"Really?"

"Yeah, you too. At the hotel. They'll tell you."

"Who's there?" I ask. "Who cares?"

"You, me, someone. You're still there. You're still here! And probably … as good as you, at any rate."

"I can't, can I?"

"What do you need?" the man asks. "Stay in the hotel? It's hot here."

"I'm cold."

"Well … at least you have to warm up, so it won't get too much. Tell somebody to warm up, I got news."

"What news?" I whisper, running down stairs.

"Take

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Lassalle, in a moment, Max Mosely said in English. I, I think my death is complete, I only have to die. If it's only death, like the crow, it'll be mean because it's my death. Death is eternal, isn't it, even if you never feel it?

—Not even God? Max asked.

—No, not even God, Max said. That's what happened. If God isn't God, why do we waste Him?

—I don't know, Max said.

—I think you will. If you don't die, you can die forever and come back to me when you are again what you were.

—When I am what I was? Max asked.

—When you think about it, Otto, Max said. I think death is eternal.

—Oh, Max, Max said.—I just don't know what to say. I was thinking about death, and death doesn't mean death after death.

—No, Otto, Max said. I believe in the power of rest, but when I think of death, I am filled with a strange and terrifying pain. I am afraid of death because death has hurt me so deeply.

—Stop talking about death, Otto, Max Mausch said. He spoke with his lips. Smiling, he got up from his chair. —Slowly, I'll make you some cocoa.

—No, thank you, Otto said, and he studied the boy and girl at the window. The house was more quiet than before, and the birds had quieted. Beside the table, the girl opened the book she had been reading. The poodle seemed interested in a paragraph in its mother's handwriting. Max watched her read, his lips trembling. Then he kissed her on the cheek and left, pacing up and down, chewing on his pipe.

—So I saw someone dead and I died. It's quite common. I'm not so stupid, he said.

—Who was that?

—The dog. He had a dog, the sea dog in Bern.

—The Ocean dog?

—The Sea dog in Bern.

—Did it have a name?

—Fritschaff.

Max glanced at the lift marking the floor below. The toilet seats were empty, but he knew all this without having to think.

—And the Schaff, the green dog?

—Schaff. Yes, Max said, his face brightening. He walked to the fireplace and sat on the stone step. —The Schaff. You are Schaff.

—There were two of them, he told me, a German name and a pet dog—two of them dead. I'm sure of it. Did anyone have a dog that named Schaff?

—Why should they?

—Why do we all speak English like that?

—Why do I have to be here?

—Because you're here.

—Why are you here?

—Because Otto, Max said.

—And why are you here?

—Because Max, Max said, looking past his father's head into the window. —Max does not write good-sounding names any more.

—What do you mean they're not real names?

—I mean carefully done and professional names. Perhaps someone put a name on his head one night when you were sleeping.

—What difference does it make who put it on?

—When you think of it, of course, old Max, Max said.

—And who is the next person to walk by?

—No one.

—You know who?

—It doesn't matter, Otto said. —Over a short time I won't be able to remember who I am.

—After all, Max was a German. And deep in the night he wrote a name. An English name.

—He didn't write English, Otto said.

—Nor did he know the meaning of our language. He barely knew Hebrew.

—Then what happened?

—In the morning, Max said, that's all.

—I think you're a fool. Peter Max, I'm telling you his autobiography.

—When I was full of the Schaff I yelled, shouted up the cliff. I was totally drunk. I screamed like a beast from the zoo. I screamed in the most obscene way.

—What was that?

—Schaff, a good German name for a German name.

—Why did you scream?

—I don't know, Otto said.

—I don't either. You don

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—You heard what the old fool said. Useful experience.

The Barbour Lives Here, I said, and you, you'll never know the difference between what I am and what I will be.
72. Well now now now, if I may say so, you can't deny the colour but a youth would do well to make himself invisible and in safety.
 73. I must have my legend, William. Mecca is the door, the Arab Road is the whole of the Muslim quarter, so it's fair to you, as to everyone else. I know that this is a legend but I got it from an earlier source, left in an old man who was very disturbed about a neighbour of mine, seeing madness everywhere. Look at his drawings, or is he still as rich as you say?
74. There are certain things in the Koran which are immediately striking terror. As though the Devil himself is inside. I think, remember, the Koran has passages in it that clearly described demons in the words of this Genesis. The foetus, it's still a foetus, a plump little foetus. Cat's by his own unkindest side. For his filial love. Surely human love is not like that?
75. Allow me to put your trust in God. That it's not just for a fight.
74. I'm afraid that is what has happened to poor old Walter Staples. Or to poor old women. They became mad. After their madness, they had a fit and had to be kept indoors and they never knew that they were mad. Some says she had to be suppressed. And what did she do? She burned [her own name] was to put incense in the fire, as she always does. The flames reached up in the darkness and that's when they went up, and she was screaming but they just laughed at her, on their gold-and-white faces. She never saw them. Anyway, they're dead now, and they are her offspring. I bought them from Saint Andrew's.
76. God's on his knees. Stop borrowing my title. Lie on your back, children of Paradise.
77. The Man with the Broken Stomach. The place where Saint Peter's lost his mind. Satan slides in.
78. Those who are left empty-handed are not found by the bull. I'll be careful with you. Devil is a great deceiver.
79. If Saint Andrew's lost his mind he gets his head skewered off. God's not so stupid.
80. Beware of fear. Fear will not come to you unless it chooses to come. Fear is much more faithful to its former form. In the end fear makes violence stronger.
31. Poetry could also have been powerful. There are powers that have power over the imagination.
32. When a man lies with the Devil he is becoming one of the creatures, the glimmering shadow of God. Do not forget: if you sneeze, you sneeze.
33. Under the devil's influence only the imagination can play. Make ink paint pictures, write poems. You don't know the power of the imagination. But roses are beautiful but not necessarily sapient. I like plain gold and I like composition. I like Westerns because their faces and maidenhants and canals communicate with each other. I am much interested in Spanish things.
34. Worked out the probabilities, I'm afraid, in the event something really happened. A long story, written in your tannery.
35. Did I hurt you? Oh no. Never go out there unless I'm invited. I'm watching over your life. I'll do you a good favour and not to worry. I've a modern eye. I'll watch you all the time.
—Can I ask you if you think God is a dirty old man? —This is the next chance in my life to change my religion. Now I'm going to make him one of the most beautiful pieces of peace in the world. I'm going to pay him homage. He'll be there.
48. The Divine Comedy: the Epic of the Red Breast. I must have a religious humour today.
49. A Christian Lover: you will be the centre of attention.
50. Factually, there are other beauties in this world.
51. Not bad. Not at all bad. Good colour.
52. I'd like you to talk to me.
53. I'm going to have you talk to me.
53. I want to know if there's any devil. Answer me.
53. No. No, no. No, no. 'The precious secret is not in the heart.' It's the heart. Full, nervous, brave, sceptical. And we only get one of it. Many of us think it possible to-visibility without the heart

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—Me?

—Like an animal.—

—Didn't you know that? Why should I have? I wouldn't serve in the army or anywhere else. I got out in a hurry, through the bazaar I think. I'm an old man now, old enough to know better. What I had was a few short years, that's more than enough time for the world to change. But you know how it was when you were on first-name terms with people who were friendly. And I was fond of that old-fashioned business of how you can make a pure, absolutely British personage out of Native Americans. You'll see why I'm here, in my old home, and my children, my old house down there—you'll see. Don't you think? I'm not going to organize and organize, I'm not going to participate. If you want to know how things stand between you and your children in the future, then you'll go outside and see. You can take me as you saw me, sociable chattel, you know, my chattel. See? I do nothing. I'm the custodian of my fate. You can have it all. But if you want to do what you really want to do you won't bother me again. I'll see if a private contract isn't concluded by some bureaucrat who looks as if he has a good head on his shoulders. Don't think about getting rid of me, slowly by developing some sort of shuttle ad for someone … or maybe you can arrange another meeting at a distance. Shame about the bonds, make up for humiliating a few years. I hope the humanity of your contretemps with me ends with this or that unsatisfactory conclusion. You know, see? It will. You will keep me in your arms. I'm just my arms, my arms and my chattels … I'll have to carry them themselves, my arms. Whether I have them in my choice, I'll have to have them. If I lose them, or that other person, you are my possessions. Not an item you can grab and pull and carry. Between me and the world of solid objects I am sure of a certain decision; you know how a man reacts when he's with a woman. You know how a very false and deceitful woman will have made for each of you, and quite as soon as you get away with it, you are protected by the fact that you are the prisoner of someone else's destiny, that you are not yours. Yes. Because if you don't have the right, you don't have the chance. Unless I'm wrong, you will have to live without the permanent devotion to equality that is required by a state of being. I've put that in the first place, in that first moment, on your behalf. I'll not be there when the decision is taken you know. I'm not going to be there when it is taken. You don't want me to be there when there's a decision you don't have to make. I'm not going to interfere with what's going to be done. I'm going to listen to you, over the phone, and I'm going to be a witness to both the good and the evil you've done. You talk in the morning before you go to work. Don't you remember? You can't also call me 'victor' enough to convince me that the sort of love-making you enjoyed with your ex-wife in the bush was not only for pleasure but also for commitment, fulfilment and fulfillment. I've put it better than the word 'love'. Your 'victory' was not the creation of your own fantasies but the stuff of your life. You could have chosen the consequences of what you did with so little effort. Yet, and I'm sure you'll think very finely of yourself, for your own sake, you did not take into account your motives' feelings' needs for being tempted to behave as if you had the capacity for any other form of gratification. You were satisfied with your feeding and the caterwauling of your new-born screaming baby, so pleased with your good times and your plans for a response to the public at large, so happy with your status and structure that no one had ever seen you clowning about in a natal village without a passport and on a petty raid on a brothel. This was your life—you were the man of the establishment and would not be a subject of a raid on a madwoman's farmhouse, the kind of retribution if you were caught, but I don't think anyone ever caught you of that sort. You say this without conviction. Now it's after the Callous Incident, now it's after the tragedy—now you're talking as if the very existence of the forest is a miracle. It's true that there are a few small trees that come out of the up a thorn

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

—What you have now you will soon be free of.

The Bantu said nothing. There was no laughter in the sky.

—What you decide is this little bird you have.

—Its name is my name.

The Bantu blew softly and the bird squirruped. Some among the swans flew in circles above the horizon, shrieking and crashing as it tried to bob, useless. Their antlers became cloth around their thighs.

—I won't call you Nana Ngwana.

—You not your wak' to me, my children. My name is my name.

—Africa never gave you one unless you lived there.

The Bantu spoke quietly in English.

—I called you so you could wake up. Our name is Nana Ngwana. Remember all this?

—I've never forgotten.

—Oh yes you have. You beat the sun with how much you beat the sun with how much you beat it. And after it you will have accomplished nothing. And even if you have destroyed it, you'll have won something for this place.

—I want to begin all over again.

—You must be tired. You must get dry.

—The Bantu must help me to go to the bathroom.

—The Bantu will give you water and food.

—I don't want to eat. I want to sleep.

—Where? Nowhere.

—I swear to you, my children, I have never told you the number of times I saw an empty water bottle pushed out of you.

The bantu stepped closer, and the earth, a primeval fungus, glimmered like rusty metal. The bantu stepped back, and the man who had spoken to the bantu inserted his instrument with a creak, and the creature fell to the ground with the suddenness of a rag doll. As he finished, the bantu picked up the man and held him standing against his back for a moment, to see what would happen. He was not crying now.

—You are a Bantu. You are our Ngufu. It is your god.

The bantus blinked.

—Nana Nwana, my children … I never told you the number of my god, Nana Nwana. And he spoke gently but firmly, as men speak to animals whose number is zero.

—Rama!

—I knew that you until I saw your girls.

The man's voice trembled, and the bantu grabbed him with a claw and shook him from his feet. The bantus fell ahead of him, rolling and thudding each way they went, swinging their spears in the air.

—DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ME?

Rama picked up a small mocha and began to whip his scalp over Rama's head with it, seeming to strike a blow. Rama was crying with hunger and rage and the bantu marched forward.

—You forgot to change your name, my children. You are named for your father. Your father is Confucius. Lie with us, sonny. Don't ever change your name.

Rama let out a piercing whistle and the bantus, still relieved that his drums did not make a noise, raised the stone of Khana and threw it high into the sky.

The backwards bantu struck again from above. Rama fell, and the tree of the world began to chaise longues. A bantus listened and lay down next to his Frenchwoman.

—Come close. I have a queen of it.

The bantus listened and lay down in the flaps on the ground. The tree of the world cried for the fire to be restored. It growled like the sea.

—Come close close, my children. Come close.

—The Bantus created us, the only ones there are, the gods, and they started out from their own source. You are our royal princes. You are the ones with none but us. You are the men of the forest.

Rama and the bantus, in forty days and forty nights, heard the rain falling in groups of six.

—You know they killed us, Ratatat. You've not known them for a hundred years.

—Come closer.

—You walk in the forest, the blind, you walk in the forest. A woman is your wife. She is your Lady Mother. You travel in the forest alone. You kill other men and you feed on the rich roots of trees. You use the forest like a palace. You feast.

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
Since the way I got off with my past, Oryx has been a burden on me, because it's gotten to say a lot of things to me. This was a shock to her when I pooped down in the Super-Centres; but the shock is now that she feels some responsibility for me and I'm beginning to show a tendency to succumb. I don't see her making jokes about things, but at least she doesn't throw stones after every misplaced bit of dirt.

Because in her heart she was always a strong woman. She was the one who could bear a salad bar or two, say, when I had no money, and she wasn't afraid of those pursy psycho-hard-bitten sadists. She spent a lot of time telling me her secrets about the ways I'd been ruined by the past. If it was true, in the old days we'd been seen together less often than we used to, but she didn't say so and I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be otherwise. Maybe it was just my conscience.

I'm not sure why, but that's what I probably felt as a kid. I guess if I'd had drinks, maybe it would have been better to have somebody take them away from me. Nowadays, I seem to be in the position of the rich old tyrants: they seem to me like the possessors of a treasure trove. Anyway, it wasn't the money, it wasn't the old money: I hated the stuff. I hated spending it between the legs. Growing up I hate spending it, and I hate the way I still have to live the life of the rich, in a way that's filled with everyone's lackeys. They want to give you a fancy gift and a way of life. They want you to be loved.

It doesn't make me rich. It's like I'm a doll. A doll that's grown up poorly. Smoke from open windows cloaks the eyes, so you can't see. It doesn't matter that I'm a bad sort. I might as well be a doll.

No, that's not true. It's true that I have a spirit, a presence, a way of life, so that's what's scary. I go through life like an animal, lashing out at the world.

How I wish I could be able to do that better. I don't know why. I wish I could be like a carving, cut out in pieces every now and then, because then I could chew up all the scraps and make a feast of them. That would be better.

I wish I could be more like a crow. I wish I could wake up every morning like a crow, and go off and do a few things with it, like picking the brain cells. That would be better too, because there's always more to crow about. Better than the swathes and the pebbles, the crows, the owls – I don't know what they do. I don't imagine that warm crow-cawing is so very important, but sometimes I do wish I could be like those birds: creepers pecking. Better than the frostbitten hen that pecks on your window, the snivelling crows that peck on anything, the ravens that peck on anything. Oh, let me at least be able to hear what they are saying. I hear them all the time.

That vision of air splitting open to birds. That sounds like something from the old days. It wouldn't work out that way. What would I hear then? Seals of crackling.

If I were a bird, then I would be near impossible to birds. The World of Birds would be my geographical home.

I mustn't throw stones at them, because I'm scared of them. If my mother catches me throwing the most terrible things at her she'll not know what to do. I'll be blamed. I'll be placed in my bunks of a cold-water cottage by my ward, forced to eat my meals in my cage and to sleep on straw. She'll tell me the opposite of what's true. She'll call my mother a liar. Because of her, no fish will ever be born from the sea again. Nothing at all.

No, that's what I wish I could do. I wish I could dispose of my hiding places quickly, since soon after it was time for school I would be free. Critics would describe me as eccentric but I don't look eccentric. It makes me feel a little neglected. That's the advantage of being in the middle of things.

My mother had come in for her first job in the fields. She can't have been doing anything else since the family fenced her out on me. My father says she cheats and steals

That night in the village when they woke up the sun was already licking the whiteness of the old storehouse roof and Lupe was lying face down on the bed.

—You scared, huh?

—What do you think?

—I don't know what you're scared of. You scared of what happens when the bullet actually goes off and kills someone real quick.

—Thx you know we're not going to hurt you.

—Thx you know how to defend yourself. You don't mess up the house any more, do you.

—Don't mess up the house any more, you jerk.

—You will have a bullet-hole in your brains.

—Get me out, Lupe. Out of here before I crazy up again.

—You two are alone, don't you know that. You're alone.

—But I am alone.

—You stay closer to me, Lupe. You know I'm a liar.

—I know how you lie.

—First I don't know if I'm lying or not, a little bit of truth here somewhere. Green this very day. Purple this very moment.

—You come here to this village to sleep.

—I dream about you.

—And my tattoos you can see through. You see the colors in them?

—You remember that.

—Okay, so I remember you. I remember you lying on the bed that night with me, you scared scared out of everything and I'm not kidding you, just because you got scared. My mother would feed you crickets. She fed my sister Josefa. So you weren't scared. So we'd sit on the porch and she'd start up the birds too, she just sat there underneath the porch. She would stay there until you got scared, but you couldn't forget her. She made love to you, but you scared her. Anyway, you got your stitches open, your little boy was walking around all night, and she couldn't feed anyone so I can't remember. So I wouldn't have any other tattoos. So you get into the car and get in the back so you could drive. And you get in the back and then you're back where you started. Okay? You're alone, your mother won't be back. In the city, she can be up with her family, in the city you can be with anybody if you want, those people are always watching. So I'm not telling you what it feels like. Where's my mother? You can joke about my mother, but you can't forget my mother. No, man, I'm telling you what it feels like. You saying: so I am alone, I got killed.

In the desert town the only sound is the lapping of sawhorses and horses' hoofs on the freezers.

Everything was so quiet it was eerie.

Did you remember the point? We held our hands in front of our faces, in front of one another. Lucy actually opened up her palm. The little bundle of fingers looked weak.

"What?"

Lupe flinched. Her teeth clicked.

—

"Lupe, did you ever imagine that people could love you so much? First time? After you left here? After I saw you in that secondhand blue-dress dress? Did I really not see you until October, when I got to know you? Was it like that when I first heard you talking on the other side of the glass window? After I got my first look at you, in Penn Station, in Daddy's car?"

"Holy cow," said Lupe, and then the details streamed into her head, the details of her fear of the light, the smallest thing a person could feel, her fear of the ground beneath her feet as the rest of her body stopped moving. She could see her mother's face in front of her, and it was the same as that woman's face, but when she turned to look at her mother she found she was all eyes, and blood and pieces of bricks hanging by her feet in front of her face and the blinkake that was part of her all at once for the

—I'm trying out here. I tried out for myself in Afghanistan. But I can't get back there. I'm lost, and I can't go back.

—I know. You were there.

—I thought I was going to be another name. And where is that other girl?

—She's in Johannesburg. She's on a staff trial.

—But we came here, Tess, that's all there is. We can have a home there, even if we're in South Africa. Why should it mean anything to you? There's nothing there. You can't go back there from the beach, it's safer. I told you. You have nothing. You're nothing. You're just the same … nothing … nothing … nothing …

He got up, and once emptily, from the edge of the bed, he stirred the contents of his pockets, taking instead a strip of plastic I'd seen hanging on the wall. I had not seen him do this for a long time. I went into the bathroom and stared into the mirror. Above me the snow fell again; the flakes were cigarette-styling.

—You understand? If I'm here, then you're not here, either. You don't know what you are, and I can't help you. You know what you're made of.

He was standing in the kitchen, looking at me. He was naked. The suit he wore was white. I saw at once it was wrong. The grotesque close-fitting trousers, the button-roll shirt, the wispy skin of the skin beneath. For an instant it seemed that he did not recognize me. I put on an old shirt and khaki trousers and stood barefoot in the bathroom. I asked, 'What's the matter? You're drunk.' He looked at me with suspicion and raised a finger. He embarrassed himself by running down the hall and came into the kitchen with the bits of paper I'd swallowed, The Director, he said. I stood on the cold tiles of the bathroom, looking with repulsion at him, and knew that his wrongdoing had been no more right than he could have imagined. He stood there sobbing, turning over on his side, as I did, I suppose, the once rare puncture.

He went back into the house and locked the two guns in his dressing-room. When he came out I was sitting at my desk. He went over and sat down on the chair by my chair. There was something florid and bloody on the table. There was blood in his fist. When he looked at me the veins stood out rigid with a throb of violence on their surface. He said to me, with placid inevitability, 'You–you've killed me.'

I said nothing. He picked up the bits of paper and began again to write. He took the scrap of paper and began to write. I waited. He wrote and I waited. Again the blood dripped, again the fist flailed and the blood wrenched into the blotch while his fingers slid over the bleeding joddi, there were the red-black bruises again and soon the wobble of the veins, the sharp dreadfulness of it, soon his grinding old face was lifted in the glassy mirror of his own face. I waited. I did not move. He had clenched his teeth and he could not stop, I knew it. It was as if he were chewing – his teeth were clenched in his mouth – a whitish substance sliding down his thick old cheek. This was his face, I saw it clearly, stained for ever by my blood.

He said, 'You started the fire.'

'I was there only a few days. I was home by myself.'

'A Jew starts fires.'

'What? A white man starts fires. Dynamite. The business of life. Every day. I could still hear the roar of them. He's coming for me.'

'You need to be careful with that fire,' he said, 'I could have killed him.'

No, I didn't need to be careful with that fire. I would not stand for it. I couldn't bear it.

He said, 'You have to be careful with that fire.'

'Yes, I'm sure I do. It's unlikely, even. What are you afraid of? You've killed someone. Yourself. Exactly as he wanted you to slay him. I can't stop you.'

'It's wrong to be afraid of something dead. It might kill you.'

The theory you had that I was an emotional addict reeking of love was true enough. Testimony from my wife, corroboration of years of bad behaviour, landed in the light of day and did its work. He looked at me, surprised, the

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

"No, Shameless Matter, you make a mistake. What you think you've found is intelligence. You turn it on. You still have a mind, don't you? It's got a form. It has eyes and a body. Your intelligence. You've got the intelligence to know what you know, didn't you? You're an old yob, Sandy. The world's old too. You can't just ditch it as a man leaves a woman. It's not one of those replacement lives anymore. You can't go back there. You can't let it go back there again, you can't just let it come back and make a life where it belongs. It's a big commitment, my friend. You've got to make it better. You've got to—and you've got to make it never better."

"I can't make it better."

"You know what I was going to say as long as you were sitting there listening to me. There's not one thing, Holy Mother, that I can praise twice. If you're going to be quiet as a tomb, I think you have to be quiet. You're not wise enough, all right. You can't make it better. I think you use this business of dwelling. What I try to say is that God made you. Not as a result, believe me. No, the person who made you—and I do personally give a damn about you—the person who made you was something else. Some other force, some other force—God knows what it was. I think it was something to do with individuals. God doesn't make these things perfect. Solomon, off to Babylon in the company of Zilchkas. Forgive me for talking like this, but that's only a way of saying that a God is great. That's what he did, Solomon, God made you what you've got. This is a word—fleets. An imperfection where one found before. Not complete. God did it. No, those are not perfect. God rejected them, Solomon, He rejected the perfect which God made imperfect. You've known that for some time. You've known about Peter until it's poison. You've known about York, who's been here for a long time, who's come through so bad, who's foolish, who's ridiculous, who makes mistakes, and who makes his book into a success. You've known about my own genius. You've known that I've gotten on in my father's defense. I've known that your father's always out for me. I've known all about you since I was a boy, every one of you. Your father, old one, can't keep his hands off me, his hands not leaving my mother's. He's come through for you, but not by design. You've had a father, and I've been your mother. You've been a mother both to me and to Tara. You've got your mother to look after you. I'm your mother. I can't escape you, you can. I'm your mother. But I don't love you, and if I don't love myself, I'm sorry, my God, I kid you a lot and you say you're the bastard. Well —slip away, my little angel, out of the way. But you shouldn't do that, Alan, you're in danger. I'm not cut off, Alan, you can't keep me out. You have to be in there, wherever it is, and live it. That's what I want to tell you. Somewhere else altogether. You've got to stay. Take your life with you, wherever it is.

"Everything we've broken up, as far as my body is concerned: the building, especially the books, which are so good, the way things seem, the books in the trash still doing well. I'm not going to stay here, my idea is to go back. I'm going. Take you with me, my little girl. Take you aways, and if there's any better place in the world than this, better than anywhere in all of this, then anywhere in all of this, whether you find it, then leave me behind and go your way. Tara, too, who's had a bunch of doctors, craziness, they'll forgive you."

"I love you. Tara, Alan. Can we still love each other?"

He opened his eyes, no longer aware of Jamie and he felt the heat of this beloved face. He felt he could press himself into the bare skin of this woman to protect himself. That was something he would take easily. Tara didn't know her mother, and the only books she read were supposed to be her mother's, and she had never seen Alan. But now he felt his bond, and at the sight of this body almost as strange as the skin

Her mouth eased into silence.

The Island, somebody is scared of it, said Rumfoord, breathing. He looked at his watch. His wife. But what was the matter with her, this man? "When they get to the other island, there will be trouble," he said.

What, you didn't talk about this?

About the other island?

The Island of Naval's Patrol?

The third island, the one you told me about.

The Moon, Jupiter, you told me about, said Rumfoord.

Which?

Jupiter, Taurus, was your brother's favorite, you went to school with him, didn't you?

Oh, yes.

He had you back all the time, didn't he?

Well, yes. But married into the Moon, you were always pretty, and very sweet.

You married him into the Moon, Jupiter, you waked me up every night for a minute and there I lay, my wife and son and all.

Never married your mother when you were a child, said Rumfoord. Illegible people don't count.

They'll probably kill you, said Salo. He was now shaking his head. Nobody had ever killed me, probably.

No, said Salo.

Never had any trouble with women, either, said Rumfoord. I never once had to get married.

You were pressed into service, you know, said Salo. You had all the love you ever wanted.

Ah. Had all the love I ever wanted, said Rumfoord. Never married yourself, either. Never had a woman's love, and never had to have one, either.

Sorry to have you been here, says Salo.

Very sorry, said Salo.

He looked up to see that two mighty edifices of blue steel were approaching from the harbor of Mars. One was a tourist street on Mars. The other was a free hospital and hospital and emergency room for those who really needed the treat. Malaria, typhoid, tuberculosis.

Mali had lost his way, said Salo. He was the only one in the world who knew the way he was.

You, he knew, had been cut off from Earth, the planet, the universe. He knew you had no services. He turned to consider the edifices of Mars.

They were nothing like the Mare Nostrum of Mars, he told himself. They were all a bit of fluff on the skirt of that great incandescent rock.

The breasts of women, he now knew, were not.
Isolated Tule, Tenuous Salt, and Antarctic Cockroach
THE TRABES TO SPACE
They were all girls in the twelfth-century Middle Ages. Salo's wife was Aphrodite. Her arms were to the right and the left. Her body was at the mercy of a man and his two kids. They were YouTube images in itself.

She was longing for a husband of her own.

She wanted a safe, comfortable house.

She insisted on having lots of children.

A sophisticated, beautiful house of her own, with beautiful furniture, a family with her own kids, and an indoor pool near the swimming pool.

She was longing for a man who was like her, wasn't like anybody else in the universe.

She was a few years from old. She longed for a lover.
There was no longer any question as to what exactly the blue space was. It was nowhere, absolutely nowhere, yet it felt like nowhere. Higher and higher, it seemed to be.

It glittered in the moonlight.

And it twinkled and glittered.
The dirt on the tombstones was soft, and curved like the heating coils of the electric chair. The whole tomb had a more perfect shape than the cemetery itself.

Salo's wife was right in the middle of it, in the middle of Salo's business and his personal history. Her arms were to the left, her body was to the right, and she was smiling.

She thought of herself as the third one back now, one that would produce one sane and beautiful offspring, and that, her husband, would go on into the ground, whence it was possible to gather vast numbers of people, all people, out of the sky, and they would spill from the shadows like flies from a burning, white face of a beautiful woman.

Salo's wife had five children. She would tell them what to offer them, in glowing words, in the sung spasms that redeemed them from their dull and muddied pasts. They would cuddle away in the daytime all day long, covered

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

In the bathroom I undressed.

—

Nah. You'll be sorry.

I ran back to the street. "What was all that about?" I shouted. "What are we going to do for you?"

"You're a liar and a bully," he said. "You'll change your mind."

After that I began to torment myself. I sang songs to myself. "Shut up!" I yelled. "You'll change your mind. You're going to do your best to save me from this hook. You'll try to save me and then you won't." I sang along.

I was so vocal that I could hardly think or think. I'd just go blank and then there would be a flash of pain in my eyes and a voice on the back of my head like a soundless fog. I tried to keep close to things.

One day Elsa blew down the sidewalk. I made her into a statue. I ran along the street, running, screaming, hands on my knees, feeling my way, the stone down which I carried.

They posted me in front of Main Detention.

They must have been two soldiers who had kept out of the way back there. I only stood by and watched until they could get to the door.

The room was a mouse-sized affair with a door that closed either side. I stayed outside, trying to be noticed in case they tried to stick a foot in.

There was some kind of forbidding order, or else they only wanted me past.

One of them pointed at me, and I looked for the opportunity to see his fingers.

I let myself in by weighty hinges which held the weight of a dead man.

I had a sudden feeling like I was falling through water.

Feel the touch of Crocodile's Prickling Tail
It's cold in here. I wish I was deep in the warm waters of the Ocean.
—

I can hear Margaret crying outside my tent. I can hear them more clearly than I have. My flashlight is out and my boots are off to hell.

I'm very cold, except for my eyes.

I'm in a room made of hot, hard, clear polyethylene. I'm lighted from a small bulb I can't see anywhere and actually the room has a nice smell of nice people. I can see something after I shut my eyes. It's not wasting—it's a nice smell. It's nice to be hiding.

It was here I buried my little sister. In my heart I know she was the little one. The little one who I used to hear singing all the time, singing in the shower, singing to the dog, to the milk bottle. Always doing that song. And very proud, always wearing her little ship in the water. But I know I'm in my own body and shackles aren't there. That's what I am. I'm there and it's not the Michael Jackson of the ocean where I was a child. It's the Michael Jackson who's in my body and I have a child and we will never go back to the way we were before.

It doesn't matter now. I know we will come to our own cave and of course I will love her very much.

It will be meat and water to her, my little girl. What kind of meat, and what kind of water.

The room could give me such a pleasure as any other.

Who cared?

"It's cold here" is very descriptive weather, tall and cold.

I'm going to think of her sometimes.

I'm too cold now. I am a fish.

It's something living like a snake.

I am my own cat.

What a strange expression.

My mind is something that speaks. It's me.

I am myself.

It would be better to say the whole mind.

I will be like a dog. I couldn't take care of myself. My belly was too flat. If I didn't feed it was very difficult. I had a bad diet and sometimes I was sick. Sitting on my chair all day watching TV, high-kicking all the time. If Mom saw me through Sid's fence at the entrance and she said, "Who do you think you're talking to?" I would turn and face her, go numb and go off somewhere else.

I think of Margaret sometimes.

I talk to myself, but to black people very softly, talk my way through them, talk and think.

I don't think of her now. I don't think of her in daylight, or in winter when I am outside the tent. I couldn't think

-------------

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

The emotions, we're all emotion.

[Long pause.]

Do you feel angry when I say this?

Yes.

[Long pause.]

I don't feel angry when I say this. So what do you think?

I don't think anything.

We're all feeling emotion.

It's normal. The only time emotion. Feel it. Feel it well. Feel it so much as you feel it, just for the very first time. Feel it as something, stand over here and feel it, feel it. Feel it these moments, over and over. Feel it a lifetime. [Pause.]

It's average.

This is the first time I've ever felt emotions.

The only time. What do you feel?

I don't know.

This is the first time I've seen this woman cry, and it's the last time. Shut up. Shut up. Just keep talking about feeling feelings.

I don't know.

What do you know? What do you know? About this woman? Do you know what this woman feels? Know what this woman feels?

Could be our last words.

Are you sure? Can this woman give you the things you're after? I don't care about this. And I don't care. But I don't care what she feels, either, not anymore. That's why I'm telling you these things. I care about the fullness of our conversation. Not about love, or about what we have to say. Is this true? Is this what she felt? That I'm the last person she would've trusted? That I can never rescue her?

Her answer to the questions had been brief. She'd said, "I know what you think." She'd said, "To be miserable every day is to feel miserable." She'd said, "I know you think this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. That misery is the stupidest idea anyone could ever come up with. In my opinion, it's true. That the most unpleasant things can be beautiful. Things without value. People without hope. People without hope.

I'm telling you this. I feel it in my guts as I sit here." She'd sat right there, propped up on her elbow, one arm slumped across her knee, the other bent out to join her husband on the pillow. "I sit here, and I feel it in my guts, and I feel it in my guts, and I feel it in my guts inside me. And I'm telling you this, don't you get scared out of it. I feel it in my guts. I feel it in my guts. I feel it in my guts in my guts." She'd sat there a long time. Shut up, brain-dead. This is the first time I've ever told a man that. Shut up. Shut up. I know you love me. I know you think all of this's normal. That I'm not crazy. I know that I have love for you. You know what I'm talking about. But I'm telling you this. I'm telling you with complete conviction, because that's what makes the difference, that this is the last time we're going to be in the same room. I'm telling you because I'm scared. Inside, I'm still in shock. But I'm in shock and I'm going to keep on telling you this, because it's the only way I'll accept that I might not be crazy if I can't be crazy and just live with that. I understand that it's totally selfish of you to love me, and I'm still in shock, and it would never work. So just give me the way to live, and I won't take any crap. Give me the way it goes. And let's just go into this one room and talk all the time. Because that's what I want. That's all I need and I don't know what's better. Love or sex. I'm not crazy. I'm not in pain. By the way, secret of the robbery, I took two thousand dollars down in the pawnshop when I found out I got it from Joana. I didn't see her again until late last evening. That's the way crazy people get. Not seeing her would be, actually, the most terrifying thing. That would be as frightening to the crazy as seeing her. Because she was so good to me." She'd stopped. She'd looked around her as she spoke, as though she'd forgotten she was there. Then she'd put her wrist across her stomach and she'd continued. "I feel it in my guts and I'm telling you this. I don't know what it would be like, living with that. But if I could only take everything, simply everything—in my guts

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

It is everything. What we all become.

There are no spells to exorcise, or luck in the park, or calculations you can't solve. No Cthulhu. No Raja Namaji. No Darwin. You have just to eliminate your actual life and let it die.

Still, knowing who to be, who to give up in the name of the unborn.

Your point of existence. Your point of no return. Feel that it's May. Feel that it's Thursday. Feel that you have fettered days ahead, they're just beginning, and they'll get longer for you, they'll get longer for you. Don't forget. They'll get longer for you. Keep the mitts on the ground. Don't worry. You don't trust them. You trust the chickens on the yard.

Not J. P. Morgan, your mother and brother.

I guess that's right.

I'll grant you that. Take the charge. At your age you can't have friends to crave for. You need friends to keep you out of enemies. What you might as well call the rest of your life friends, you can name a string of friends with.

Where's your sister?

She disappeared.

Where?

I don't know.

Go find her. Make her a new friend.

It's good to see her again. I miss her. But now, when I have her, I won't miss her anymore. You know I feel bad about losing her and, for some reason, I wish it hadn't happened? So don't think you're in pain. Pretend you never knew her at all, don't give her another thought.

Hold on to your walls, and I'll look in into your eyes, he wanted to rove around the house, but he found it black. She's gone forever.

You won't know who you're supposed to be or who you're not.

I never knew.

She never lost her.

No, I mean—no, she isn't. She is. This here is our grandma. She's going to live with us till the end of time, are you concerned?

No, just right now, I'm not.

That's right. You're fine as anything. Just remember she's dead.

She's dying.

Is she in pain?

She knows, she shouldn't have gone.

You must be tired.

She tolerates for ten other people. Nobody gets passed out so quickly, I figured.

So you want to look after her, to make sure she gets strong enough?

It's easy enough. Do you make a mess of yourself?

Dang if it doesn't.

If someone offers you a pail of salt water, let them do their job.

I don't care if she gets stronger. I don't care when she's gonna die. But if that her doctor isn't going to save her, I'm going to cross myself. Promise me you'll hold out.

I know, he said.

Good. I'm going to ring the hospital. I'm going to have a look around. Have you got anything good to give me?

Your mother's ashes.

The one I want, the one she took with her, the one she had in front of her, she's already holding it. More than alive, I'd say, if she's still alive.

Good.

Thank you.

Yes, thanks, I said.

I left the room and opened the door to the kitchen. Good people, the way they all seemed to die.

Oh, it's probably a little of both. The one who died, and the one who took her life. He's the one told me about her, I'd say.

By the time I got home, the (going back to the house) sound of the taps had woken me up, and I went back there. I found Jane covered with cold wet dead things like mine and Amigo's. She was just lying on the floor, jerking her leg out at the edge.

No, I told her.

Your mother?

Yeah.

I took off my own shoes and started straightening them up.

Please don't say anything.

I couldn't help it. I put the shoes on and started towards her bed. She was dead. She'd been killed by her own hunter. He had killed her dog and it was a fat dog, too. When I said to him: No, I don't think so, it was just a dog. (He'd told me what I'm telling you. I've already told

Reading from the same horror story, in action and mentality—I could take a dozen such stories in my book. Fantastic. I could fill it up go all stages of the horror, from first to the last chapter. When that happens, when I'm supposed to write that scene, the first part is over. I'm the story now. The rest of it proceeds up and down, like rats.

The director says, "We've an opening night for the Broadway edition. I know we've got three hundred people to plug it, repast with the rest of the cast. But the last few people want to say their piece. I have to do it without them, otherwise they'll shoot the pieces into the press. I told the editor what I said. This is what my opinion was. I remember what he said: 'My gay body will have to go to war with homosexual-rights mobs.' "

The director says, "If you like, I'll play the homosexual parts in the intermissions. I never thought that the man perverseness of his black pride would work so well for an audience. I'm having them write the perfect ensemble. I've come across some beautiful scripts. One of them, I have to do a typical double-take behind my back, and my editor wants to make sure I don't change the order. He says he comes here very often. She certainly can't remember what he looks like."

The director says, "Look at the audience, at first. Think of all the people who were there up there on the roof."

"Who?"

"The crowd. Do you see any people? They're there. There's a hundred thousand of them. It's the only crowd I saw. You know what it sounds like?"

"No."

"Well, imagine that they came down there from the roof and made speechless faces at the total opposite. Perhaps they projected their mouths open, a sort of sound splayed out in pleading.

"The audience would have exploded with story. Maybe they wouldn't. I don't know. All I know is that they would have exploded with the crowd."

The director says, "From the very first day the audience was very not all there. Some were very disturbed by the sight of the performance. I wonder what that must have meant to the audience. They must have found this very exciting."

"Is that why the talk has been so fantastic at the opening? Because the crowd reacted to it with great passion?"

"No. They covered their faces. They could have screamed or something. But no one did. There'd been hundreds of people up there. We sat there and watched."

"And all those crazy strangers, hoarding examples of their lives and wishing them dead in the day's first moments of joy."

"It's wonderful that they did that. In real life, they wouldn't have hurt one another. We wouldn't have had time to do their bit of heaving around."

"And as the audience said, 'That's just not true.' I see the office party. I think about the guy here. The olderhead."

I read the documents and said, "That's Donald Justice. His wife is divorced."

"Oh? That baffles me. That's the one that's big and bad-tempered. Can you picture him going out and taking a short stroll with the young people? I never saw him take a short stroll." (He was walking along the street, slowly, one step after another.)

"And what do you think about? How do you treat him?"

"Yeah, I think I treat him like shit," (He and his wife had split up?) "and I think we have to stop him. And that's what I'm really interested in," he said then, laughing bitterly as the performance continued.

"And what are you truly interested in?"

"Just so I can stop Donald Justice."

"I think I could be wrong. He's a man. He's a grownup. You're not a child."

"Oh, you may be right."

"Do you?"

"No, not at all. I think you're too good for him."

"That might not be possible."

"He's not that bad."

"I doubt that."

"He's not anything. He's not that bad."

The director says, "Well, we're lucky that he's here and this is a successful attempt at a revival. Remember, get right what you get. Get right what you get, man. What the hell. This is what you get getting your every little bit too quick."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Well

The mind is everything. What you think you become.

After careful recuperation, after a long period of despair of some kind, the heroine finds she is able to get some that is less restful than what she had been craving. No more, no less. She loves the developing arms, the sense of capability and openness to receive and obey, she loves the vision of a man who will grow into something more than himself; she loves the feeling of the whole thing, full of growth and power, with enormous results. To lose one man, to gain more, a thousand, a thousand times more, to train for years and years, to conquer a hundred cultures through the magic of incongruous manners, language, art—and then to lie in bed on a mattress and wait for death. Everything. Living like a woman with a man is the most powerful thing there is. She tries to find it in the book, in the pictures, in herself.

She can't stop being persecuted by others. As she was tricked into thinking she wanted a man who, unlike the others, would be a mystery. She wants to be the one who is mysterious. She wants to be the one who has turned the world upside down. She wants to be the one who is something more than the other. The magic is not enough. He must have a special way of living. She envies only the power for which he has the powers to destroy.

Gettysburg. My own love for and for my family, you saw it.

Good marriage is as hard as a hundred million hard hats. Don't fuck with me.

He does not understand, she says to him on the phone to tell him where she is.

She never was married before. All the men she ever loved had wives. They would like to, couldn't they? She is not a giraffe, she is not a fool. She is not a cripple for nothing. She came from a great stock of strength. Once she had thought strength herself, once it had me in her arms, her thoughts, helped her with her feelings for me, convinced herself that I must protect her. Now her power no longer mattered. Soon, the strength had worn her away. She had lost that strength. Now the strength had gone out of her. I only serve others, she said to him. I am nothing to them.

She does not know how to read that sentence. Her resistance, her hatred—she has no way of knowing them now, no way of restraining it. Love is lost. It is her and this is her. She listens to the song sharply, by the pitcher. Her anger is gone.

I know you, he says. I knew you anywhere.

And if I didn't?

Because I couldn't. You found me.

I was in the car. I was driving out there. In the shoulder. Olga was there. Just sitting in the backseat. She had her cigarette in her teeth. I remember how she looked out the window. Her eyes. So thin then . . . But I did not want her to leave me because of . . .

Because of what?

Whatever she has done to me, in the past few years . . .

But you were angry because you couldn't get me involved, you said so much about me.

I think I did.

Then it came over you?

Yes, anger came over me. I was driving north. I had a girlfriend for a while. She had a birthday party. I was going to give her a bath and she was pale as a sheet. I got into the front seat and she got into the backseat with her cigarettes. She was looking toward the shack that wasn't there. I must have looked out the windshield, because that's where I helped her. She got to the third knobby knoby, a stone that big. They mostly throw stones into things nowadays. They're what they get.

I wish I had a cigarette. I wish I hadn't smoked.

Not smoking is good for you. It's bad for the lungs.

You're making my lungs see things I don't see.

I guess.

The following day, Laura sat on Wright's balcony in the sun, her back to the gardener, she and the dog in the garden, and she saw them. She called out the dog's name—the kind of kangaroo whistle that makes a person believe that—she called out the dog's name—and she stared down her back, down her body, as if she could see in the palm of her hand, and she saw what there was up there and she heard more than just this whistling, she heard the very loud wind whistling and she saw her face menaced by the incredible climbing and crushing of her eyes. She saw herself, hurt

The mind is everything. What you think you become.
Tammie
Tammie's body was rough but her face was cool and youthful. She liked to be dressed in nude stuff, especially when she felt threatened or humiliated. Her family used to keep her in their clothes, in their houses. They wouldn't let her out of their yard, so it was only the outside world that they really knew. Tammie covered her body with a bedsheet or a towel. She wore two kinds of diaper, one being a pair of socks, the other a dishcloth. Neither of these items ever worked well. But Tammie was afraid of the warmth of the sun, the light. She had a sweating duck jacket. She kept it on long after it was sold. There were bills before her eyes and they were the same, always the same. She hated the bills that landed on the pavement. She hated the girls that knocked people off balconies and threw objects at windows, who laughed, winked and cried at her. Then she would close her eyes and something of her respiratory tracts would lighten.
So now she and her belly sloped and curved. Their movement was odd. There was too much of them not to touch. They were the chubby kids on the Nurses' Committee. They tickled her and bit her. They did that as a matter of fact and it made her feel tender. She thought there was some hidden strength in their love. Later she realized there was none—they were interchangeable. Like two peas in a pod.

Tammie said to me: During the time I was in the hospital I went on my vacation. Well, the vacation's over. This is it. On my vacation.

But what vacation does one have when you've got all your work done? I would like to know.
So you can't get along with somebody who hates you out of a feeling of pity? You're not out of pity.
When Simon came back from the war he had a job in a firehouse. He didn't travel regularly, but it was in a big city, so he knew a great deal about trains and buses. He was also in charge of a cock that had been shot in the act.

Then he went to the university.

Uni Park, in the village of Uni Park, was in another valley. That was a long way from Tammie's village. It wasn't far. It was on a high hill on a gentle curve. It looked as if it would rise in a few years. I thought it would. It did, however, and the unladylike woman I called madre did it.

Uni Park was a black one and a red one. The smoke was thick. People walked along the slopes between endless black and red ditches.

They told me there were three of them: Simon, a messed up native, and madre.

They didn't talk much else. They didn't talk about the war. After a while there was never more talk, that was like leaving.

And then Simon died.
