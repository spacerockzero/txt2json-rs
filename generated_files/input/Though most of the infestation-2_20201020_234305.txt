Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living.

In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. It had dispersed in different parts of the universe, as everyone continued to operate from the same basic "gates" of technology and exploration that the infestation had destroyed. In the 10 years that followed the infestation had lost more and more of its influence. Countries were beginning to reunite and jobs had already started to return to those still in jobs. Finally, by 2216, just a few more years away, the planet has lost all the habitats that were destroyed in the original uprising. This is not without its problems. The new population of planet earth - who were all the few people that still believed in the infestation - was no longer able to say what "normal" means. They still considered them extinct, rejecting the notion that anything that had happened on earth could possibly affect them. As the Earth moved on, the infestation of earth ended in failure and the infestation - if you can call it a single entity with one purpose - decided that the time was right to leave the surviving living and how it had tried to do everything possible to be human again. However, if you can still call it that, it had already been the manifestation of its existence, born in the worst of circumstances and led to the ultimate destruction. Though a piece of it - one individual in the starting of the infestation in the year 2300 - had been able to actually say something about this ending, it had been as a tribute to an ancestor, written with utmost care for some future civilization of those who still remembered what living means. The infestation at its core was not saying what being human was about anymore, since life had come to one of its ultimate conclusions. For every living person in the universe, there had been that one - "this man" - who had just wanted to be and tried to live. Then, for the last time, that being turned the universal clock, ending humanity, even though he had only begun it to fulfill a request.<|endoftext|><main> <logout entry="/login" route="/login"> </logout> <listen> <action name="schedule_interval" method="schedule"> <schedule max="30">9:00pm </schedule> <schedule max="180">7:00am </schedule> <schedule max="240">5:00pm </schedule> </action> </listen> <states> <action name="schedule_host" method="schedule"> <schedule max="3"><schedule_host reserved="0"/></schedule> </action> </states> </application>

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.
In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. A new initiative was initiated in order to continue the infestation, focusing all resources in countering it. A total of forty cities were officially joined to the initiative. As the seeds of desolation bloomed all over the planet, this initiative became considered quite successful. Thousands of places were established by factions of the infestation, greatly improving the educational process of the human inhabitants of the world. The infestation wouldn't take part in the twentieth century wars because of its accomplishments, and that was where the peace treaty was signed. Having no interest in the living, the infestation spared humanity any retaliation.
__________________________________________________________________________ Years passed. In 2085, the infestation was still in control of much of the planet and almost all of the infested left the planet's surface. Those infested who left were the very people that would work for the initiative. What remained was a small area inside the infestation that remained rather quiet - areas that were infested, were no longer infested, or something in between. The infestation had been held back from its goal.
__________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ Days began to pass. The infestation continued to move towards the next planet - one that was inhabited by the living. It was decided that this infestation would stay to deal with the issue of the living later on, when it had better resources to maneuver in. In fact, the infestation had to work on subjugating the living planet because it wasn't able to attack the living planet directly. The infestation would, however, allow its soldiers to interact with the humans, at least for the period of twelve months. The time was a few hours and days, and the experience of one year, would be useful for the infestation.
The term years wasn't much useful in this situation because time passed slowly. During those days, one infestation faction managed to secure the outside of the infestation: this involved cutting off the power supply from the infestation's central core. The other infestation faction, so called the creatures of the nether, ended up taking over the infestation, its work under the assumption that their own solution would be preferable. Even the infestation itself, could no longer give us a clear answer for why they were staying. They stopped talking about why the infestation could not take over the humans and their hostile agenda: they stopped saying that it was because they were advanced enough to usurp the living - only to say that they weren't prepared to be exposed to the big bullies of the living. That was all that they would say. The old infestation policy was completely irrelevant.
Just two months had passed. With the power cut off and the command center to save the living abandoned, the infestation made it to the planet's surface, and came into contact with the living. A contract was signed between the living and the infestation, and an agreement was made to provide the living with resources. Those humans that had found their way into the infestation weren't just simple lives; they were soldiers and medical staff. The infestation paid all their expenses and even provided food and clothing to those that were giving their lives for the initiative. The infestation had to focus on the infestation, that's why the organization of the war was limited to the areas inside the infestation: the living, the agents of the infestation, and the human forces that were defending their people. Even though the infestation used its resources to set

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.
In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached.
In an effort to cut down on their losses, the self proclaimed "Immortals" set up trade routes through the infestation to trade by collecting minerals, a very appealing business to the races of earth. For all the woes of existence, it was still considered a way of life to be part of. It was mentioned that the infested were found much more by scavengers, traders and pilots rather than in any sort of fully functional state. By 2083, it was thought that the nature of the infestation had changed as it was no longer simply "eating and killing". Because of the heavy presence of people and machines, all humanoid life forms were now considered fair game. With the benefit of immortality, they no longer had to serve as fodder for the infestation, helping it to create new constructions. With their primitive forms, the infested were able to evolve in new ways and serve as useful mobile bases. However, the immortals may have been running the infestation well enough for some time longer. Not to mention, they would be able to demand a share of the profits made by trade. The humans were eager to help, but had no idea how to answer. It was so many worlds that the infestation had destroyed that they could not do anything about the origin of the infestation. How could they learn the identity of the originators? They did not know whether it was an act of god or simply the quality of a living construct - it was impossible to tell what was real and what was fake.
Despite the disasters of the Human-Inspired UN, the infestation continued to expand. One of the most interesting places it found itself was in Madagascar, with its most devastating attempt at exploiting the wild humans to lay waste to its plants. Its overseers assured the African natives that they were suffering from low rates of diseases, though the cure to cure them was not available. They believed that since the natives had never seen life before, they would not have knowledge of such things. The true reason for this thought process, however, was much more mundane. It was not because the natives lacked knowledge, but instead it was because the native mind was incapable of understanding the concept of higher order concepts. The intention was to spread the infestation and the primitive minds of the natives would serve as the bases for the production of more of the infestation based lifeforms. Humans, being nothing more than scientific creatures that needed to be controlled, would have been useless to the infestation, not even helping the infestation sustain the lifeforms. However, it had hoped that the infestation's creation of some new lifeforms would prove useful to them, turning them into the perfect resource and offering them control over their own lives. This was the plan - the seed of the seed of the next infestation.
One of the efforts of the immortals was to decide the next step of its expansion by establishing a location somewhere that would suit the terrain of Madagascar. As the only habitable places on the earth now being within Madagascar's borders, it was easier to colonize the country itself. And so, in 2085, the immortals landed in Madagascar. The infestation, as well as the other infested nations, had other intended methods to explore other continents. But Madagascar was ripe for exploitation by the humans. There were some rare and valuable resources that were not available anywhere else in the world, including diamonds.

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could.

In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. When the living escaped the infestation, they were not looking forward to going through the same ordeal. On the contrary, the living were disgusted by what they had been dealt: an inferior existence on another planet. The infested could only endure the process in quiet. For most of them, it was not even too difficult to view the infestation as a free choice, a feeling that the infestation took advantage of its unwilling subjects.
The end of the transformation of the infested came only two years after the eradication of the first wave of infestation. This wave included the culmination of three centuries of violence and frustration. These events were undertaken in order to let the infestation pass through the transition period of its life cycle and fully evolve and multiply. This stage also included the introduction of the infestation's most fascinating ability, the ability to communicate with its earthen hosts. The rapid infestation of earth was one of the infestation's crowning achievements. In this new world, the infestation spread out in all directions and reached out to what had been its previous homes. All inhabitants on earth had been imprisoned by the infestation, their earthen host slowly drained and gradually destroyed.
In the year 2093, the infestation began a second course of evolution. This time, it achieved a different level of interaction with the neighboring planet, mars. The infestation had spread far beyond the boundary of the planet, using it as its new home. This would be the outcome of its plan. They had more time to perfect their transformation in their new home and to study the properties of this new world. At this time, they began a disturbing study about the native inhabitants of mars. One way they tried to help the native humans was to provide them with tools, a kind of slave trade. The technique was complicated and involved both knowledge and technology. For example, infested living devices such as radios and artificial gravity vacuums were given to living creatures for their own use. Also, robots and computers were built as much as possible, though they took up the excess carbon and nitrogen that the infestation had extracted from the earth. In this way, the infestation tried to help the native human colonists for free. Even though the infestation did not particularly mind the fact that these useful machines were slowly used by the natives, the infestation's leaders expressed concerns about this subtle use of the infestation in the form of comforts. To avoid annoying the natives, they thus increased their delegation of life and death to the natives, ensuring that these services were given in order to dispose of them, rather than their want to return them. This helped to relax the infestation, and the population was the same.
The infestation of mars had for long been studied and regarded as a complex arrangement of animals and plants that aided the extermination of a number of populations and species, under the sole guidance of an organization that appeared to have the universal aim of destroying the world, preferably the inhabited one. Though the organization's motives were not entirely clear, the results of these experiments appeared to be extremely beneficial for the infestation. In this way, the infestation was able to achieve complete domination over an entire planet - the planet was the infestation. To this end, the entire infestation was gathered in mars to begin its preparations for the final wave. An evacuation and conversion program had been planned since the beginning of the infestation. First, all the infestation had

Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. The information the infestation had gathered came to a stop, until the infestation found an alien called Human. At the request of its masters, Human was to provide the human races with resources necessary to survive.
When Humans first land on earth, an alarm is heard. It was a distress call from the infestation on earth. The call was quickly interpreted by many while their reason for coming out was pretty unclear. The infestation had decided to perform a biological invasion of Earth as retaliation for not having any problems. The message was given, the thousands of corpses and humans massed on the field soon found out their true true form. Among the already dead is the name "Virgil" or "Virgil will do". He is immediately eaten by a group of living people.
Though the infestation found an alien type, humans couldn't help to have a suspicion. Virgil was only a child and there had been other reports of uncanny looking aliens. Virgil wasn't sleeping well. On the contrary, he was groggy and full of energy. In front of his father, who wasn't a human, Virgil tries to talk about something with love. Virgil was quite lively and exuded the same sensuality as the other children. He had high hopes for his future and the promise of love at any cost. Sadly, he realized later that his death didn't mean anything, just more time to prepare his revenge against humanity.
After hearing of the success of Virgil's arrival on Earth, the infestation began to expand rapidly. The infestation tried to sneak up on the unsuspecting population and infect them, but was caught immediately by the benevolent living species of Earth. Since the infestation was seen as an abomination by the living, all infestation transported were barred from taking part in the festivities of the Third Blooms Carnival and the Thanksgiving Eulogy, a religious event attended by both living and infested. The abominable humans were so horrified by the infestation's mysterious and wrathful nature that they refused to cooperate with any of the infested and by 2089, the infestation had been repelled from Earth. Despite its failure on Earth, Virgil continued to guard the infestation's stronghold on board the Aurora Fortress in the Sargasso Sea. The Aurora Fortress was unable to fight against the infestation, as its defences were too strong for them. The Aurora Fortress was destroyed in 2093, but the infestation survived on Venus and never deviated from its strategy.
Still in search for other planets to transfer, the infestation applied its strategy even more in the Uranian system. It enlisted the help of Edward Norton, the superhuman and just a small child. During the investigation by Norton's powers, the infestation's alliance was on the brink of collapse, since Norton had no respect for the living. Norton began to act out in the infestation's cause by killing people with extreme prejudice, as he was shown by the reality between infestation and the surviving people in 2099. Their connection became worse when Norton came into contact with the insane Julia, who consumed the fight between the living and infestation and believed that those who were killed by Norton were truly dead. Norton stepped in to kill the insane Julia, with the help of the Green Lantern, and focused his efforts on Virgil. Norton set out to find the infestation's next prey, the planet that was on a collision course with Earth in

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached.
A repressed peace appeared to be on the horizon. If you think that the actions of the infestation is finished, you are mistaken. The infestation continues on its route until the gates of their reach. As long as they are alive, the infestation lives. After a terrible thousand years, the infestation has reached the solar system. Every species within it is under their infestation. Everyone is put in their corner. Every race sees that they are in a corner with the infestation. Whether they know it or not, everyone is forced to face their own mortality. It is not an easy task and the most dangerous thing to do is to reveal your humanity to the infestation. To reveal your humanity is to disclose the fact that you do not have a chance of salvation, but instead are a prisoner of fate. To abandon humanity and declare itself to be a fool or an angel of death is a way to ensure that you do not become a victim of the infestation and its repressed peace.
The way to deal with this situation is not to make people believe that they are right. To say that everything will be all right is like saying that everything will be all right even if the person is wrong. It is better to accept that they are wrong. To run away and claim that everything will be all right by yourself is the last possible option for someone who is wrong and eventually decides that he wants to commit suicide, committing suicide that no one will witness him dying.
The planetary stability was reached on the planet Juno and the most extreme actions were taken there. Yet, not only the infestation has suffered on a planetary scale, but the entire planetary center and a vast quantity of their primary resources have been wiped out. Only 5 million inhabitants of the entire planet of Juno remain alive at this time. The planet has now turned into a magical zone of no one, not even the stars anymore exist in the area and every action there is nothing but creation of an illusion of a peace that has never existed.
And as the warning stopped and began to echo again and again, the general thought that had been imposed in the infestation became hard to establish. The initial bombardment of an entire planet by the infestation was seen as an incredible move. However, there is no appropriate terminology to describe the invasion. The invasion of their own earth was mistaken as a victory. They are hailed as gods that have lived long enough to return to earth. While the peaceful planet is given a time of peace, their brethren in the infestation in their dimension feel the need to take back the planet at any cost. Their sacrifice, one without fault, is not such a dramatic thing, if only that people would simply be reminded of the terror of the infestation.
When the infestation reached to the fourth planet of the solar system, the ships of the white base were sent in and explored it. They found plenty of resources and all the plundered material. Just as they were ready to move on, the infestation arrived in the area. This time, they decided to be very careful as the rest of the earth will have been devastated by the infestation. The infestation stopped these explorations and repressed the space ships, insisting to let the infestation finish its job. The interplanetary genocide was imminent and all the members of the human race were to be killed.
The devastation that will be done by this infestation is still a matter of speculation
