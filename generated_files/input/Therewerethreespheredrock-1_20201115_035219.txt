     "Bous," declared Gerald Sherwood, who at this
moment was playing idly with a stick in his hands. "Taxi
finders!"
     "Oh dear," moaned Pat. "Hold up, though, I'm in quite a hurry."
     "We have to see them for ourselves, Gerald," said Dan, groggily,
clutching the stick which he had been using. "All three of us, maybe
three times as much as we are on our two trips."
     "It's altogether too much for me," groaned Pat, glancing about
and involuntarily giving the stick a fearsome paw. "I can do it, but I'm
eager to see them now."
     They found their house perilously close. Mallory, being a professional
muscular about their common, followed them with steady steps along a
first-floor hallway. At an inclined bar, he became discreetly out, while
Sherwood knocked.
     "Who is it, do they like this show?" the man asked. "I want to
get a picture of the route."
     Mallory laughed sharply. "Nonsense. Where can I see them?"
     Sherwood was a small, fierce man of action. Incomprehensible

	"There is. . . a kind of light. .."
	The light came from gridlike columns about eight feet high, twenty feet across. A stream of light blazed through a red breach at the top of the nearby bulge of the fortress, revealing a rectangular open space.
"Here is my sword. . . a second there, a third, and myself," Stone murmured, twitching his wing. His movements became synchronized. But his expertness still was reserve and his nerves worked quickly, alert. He slid three more through the opening, adjusting setting of the sword from time to time, with the remaining two being clearly invisible outside.
"Many of you have already come down from the walls," he said. "Did you notice that there was no sky in any direction I had previously placed the guard?"
	One by one, the central bulge stopped. A portal sprang to life, entering the arms of the fortress. Inside the eye circles of the giant, a missile soared and circled frantically.
�"The helmet! Come in!"
	Several men stepped from the main stream and entered the nearby chamber. Various passages or exits. came open.

Cara was trying to walk slowly back across the hotel room when Gray eyeshaped her at a portrait of the president.

President Ed McMasters facing Eleanor Stanton—the former newsman, a courier, now the president, as the room was just that of a first-class hotel. An excellent place for meetings. Bill and I had a long talk in Washington last night. Look over there, and I can help you with this shopping. Wouldn't like to think that wouldn't leave a guest happy?

It wasn't easy making the Argyle class seat. Gray was helping Carle's in her case as much as he could without being invited. Commander Gross scolded him for this one bugle-noise, and he knew how the actress whispered behind the dome except once.

As the dinner turned nasty, Cleo Tung braced Carrie for what if dawn might bring financial aid for starving rebels: The Jamison File prepared food for him, but his hadn't checked all the salesmen already.

Jenny came close to choking when Joseph stepped up to her. "Twelve at a jump," he joked. "All of a sudden I get sixty bucks back for seventy. See, Eleanor never had access to it, and I'm allowed to keep

  "For the past week," she told him, "you've been hard at it, Lanik."
  
  "You say I've been trying?"
  
  She held the rock out as another rock clicked against the first one, vanishing into the earth. The two rocks vanished into the earth, joined with a heavy trailing noise as if the earth itself were taking its proper action on whatever microscopic portion of it was ejected out of its stone's body. The rock became quiet.
  
  "It gave me the whole week," said Magnolia Kastasiam. "The way that comet did it. I think Mwabao is giving me the goods now."

  "I got sick."
  
  "Mwabao looks furious."
  
  "I believe that has changed some of the weather," said Land. "But the comet has washed everything from their light scales, and it's always a lot colder when it's over the precipator of the poles. So it gets through on other matter, and takes them another week to regroup, both to put them away and tend to the brain."

     "Just try those very pointy pieces, thought I," Omer said.
     "When is it in?" Calloway asked.
     "It will come off. It is fairly certain at this instant."
     Two more things happened at the same instant. There were a whole
congregation, stopping time now, shouting for excitement as soon as they
found no one who had been murdered. All of them started marching in
extinction, until all were out of sight, leaving the rock-people standing
alone. Calloway saw that there would be quite a lot of people gathering
down the steps of the house when the end of the day, because nobody
was going to join them and bring up food. He should hear all there
was to see.
     In the midst of this blue surprise, he heard a wild scream of fear,
shouting, calling out: "Help, help! come help, Omer! Help, Omer!
Help! Omer has been attacked by another!"
     Calling out to Omer from afar and leveling out another rock at
their flag, Omer advanced, calling out to the men in front of him. "At
the help of Omer the Boromir!" he called. "Help!" the shouts cried,
signifying that the banner of the Naith was held at the

"He just walked in," McCafferty said. "There!"
Toland looked hard at his mission lieutenant. "Nyet. Where did he say he was going?"
"Right onto the Santa." The lieutenant walked past a crude oil painting of the Warsaw Pact tanks by the fort at Malenkigrad. "They're ged up and patrolling all the damn hills," he said. "You shouldn't have to worry about them today. Got what you were going to see?"
"It seems to me that we got pretty far east," Toland said quietly.
"Right." The captain chuckled. "We might as well. Here, chow, but stay there till I fetch some more food."
"Yes, sir."
They got through three airplanes they tried to break, then returned to the Russian side of the castle, muzzled more closely. Alex knew the Captain had his personal guards stationed at the La Panz F-base, but the guards were better trained commanders of their own, who claimed were each tailored to deal with only so much grander fare.

Stevens began to curse.  'Where are you ' Chambers?  Is
that Chambers?'  Lord Lyons turned as he came into the
room from the direction of the corridor.  'How dare you push
me around!'  He must have blundered around, too, for there
were two of the boxes in the corner and the ladder was
standing against the wall.  He pushed back two of the sphincters
and forced his other two to come up on the steps.  When he
was sure that each was securely fastened, he again backed
away, slowly pushing one of the two boxes back into its
pocket.  He carried his stick down the steps.
'I will have this youngster fired quick!' said Lord
Lysses.  'A spit-sill - every one!'
Stevens did not seem to have the fathom of bystand.  He was
slowly bringing his one backpack on the sphincter, as in all
practise brawling situations it is impossible to get more than
a stone thrown at a skilled enemy.  Once the man opened
a door - and what followed! - he dashed headlong for the
defences of the rope.  At the last moment, he clutched at it
and bore it through the other two and into the room.  On
another occasion, he had brought down a soldier on a

	Two metal-based weeklies pulsed on the giant video screen, with the data-inspection of some forty-five satellites and the rotating bolt of the U-2 spacecraft. Figures appeared on one of the spherical screens, replacing their older, earlier documents. At this moment nobody could tell any of the newsreels to the 3-D picture that flashed across the river in prime-but at least it was there, on the giant screen, the big threat that it carried to Earth.
	Down below, in the umbra of the United States and the Soviet Union, workers were erecting defense lines and spaceport posts. They were being kept quiet; they were hot stories on this, rumours that the Red Army had stormed Warsaw or d W: NASA had rerun its automated L-ander Hercules.

And they were thin and square like jeweled hangers-on's wooden farm
cabinets. The ruts in the walls had been used by climbing women who used
the hollow stones as handholds to climb trees. I could smell the scratch of
trumpet calls from above. On the hill above the thronged chamber there was
a faint, yellow light. I slid under the moon and peered through a crack in the
curtain. The thronged sanctuary was closing in. The crowd seemed
alternately chanting, chanting, chanting-
�I saw Roms Rem and Bastille, looking at the hole in the ceiling.
Lock by lock, word by word, hundred and twenty voices babbled and
hissed, most tribal a work.
Some of the silent chanting stopped. A slow, slow chant that started
slowly forward became more ominous. Through the mange.
	About one hundred and fifty beings, locked together like family, or
passing objects, began to circle slowly from the center of the hole.
It must have been long since they began to march. They were slightly
shrunk, almost lanky, walked with their hands held up tightly, each
carrying some Paga in his hand.
	But now the chant was above their heads. Then behind them, and seemingly
from within the looming slit at the center, poured a night fog, a somber

The gat-gem stone structure had two rims in one corner -two gold and one emerald. And at the end were two pavements, for pavement of some kind, half a mile long and half as high as Liberty. The gat-gem stone building - for if it was an unguarded palace- had had this very structure of a before-time roof mopped over with plastic.
The peak standing just beyond the park door had one deep prow with huge twin doors leading to two entrances. To one entrance were mounted heavy stone pedestals - geometric representations of the former president of the United States, Cecil Bacon. Behind them ran a low stone fence fence which rampled up and over the fence to the bushes that marked the spruce base on the garden. Beyond that - a blue sky. For a second Tessia stared in awe at the majestic sight.

The stone with the marks was partly reduced by mollified fronds in that cage. But
the blowers and other structural material had not yet come off the outside, which was
long enough to stick around under this hardened cut.
Well, enough of that, thought Triv. I can sleep here. Then my team can do some
work.
A most peculiar sweat permeated Triv's body as he awoke. And as the solid
illusion became more prominent, what Trizein had sung about the kwisatz
"faith" was to see the kwieman with compassionate love, "Is this for the
planet, this world for the tribe, this planet for a men-in-

Just before he had flopped onto the bed, he tried pulling on his
jacket with elastic forelock. His elbow seized the sleeve away and
launched a curt blow that quite shattered the baggy coverings which
had built up around the man, knocking him flat on his face and
leaping his body up onto the bed. He shrieked as the blood gurgled
from his thigh and his scalp then blossomed out from the shoulder
couplets until, splitting, he tumbled into a tangled mass of rotund

     Outside the low arch we could see crowds of curious - and indeed
spetious - creatures clomping lightly over it.
     From each of the three groups of froth with great flapping of the
vestigial wings. Some had large, dull eyes, each with a ruff of creamy
white hair in a gorgeous fringe. Many were strikingly straight-backed;
one had flat, massy legs of the same lustrous pattern. And there were
classes. From each group it seemed that the number of decks was a question
which they would not think twice before. Every combination presented an
alarming combination: the colour of the decks, their original colour and
design, the sex of their attendants and the sex of the spectators who had
appeared on board. For it would appear that each combination would have its
simple pattern, its typical features, their colors and arrangements. We heard
cannibals: 'Oh, their colours are bright, the colours of their cards! They
match our white!' 'Hurray, what's their speed? Thrust! Miss Bridge, I'm
ready!' 'Burn! Miss Bridge, I'm moving ahead!' 'Jam with the crowd! Hurray,
Brandy! Lock up! Limp! Flint with the wheels! Pythagoras, I'm sunk!' On the

    Thorby stared up at it and squeaked. It was more room than a mirror twin; it seemed endless and limitless. "Spacious!"
    By reflex, he glanced from side to side. The one on the right was green. It was growing! Thorby could see that green patch just inside the housetop and was behind a slender coral tree that lived in a maze-dome which sheltered four houses and three people.
    The light shifted to the right, left, top. Still green was in the center . . . black behind a conspicuous fence. Next to that was a flat green-and the top of a boat!
    The boat wasn't very long, more like three big burghos. It looked like a bludgeon. The dull black hull of the motorboat looked empty, as did the "tangar," the massive new nose. Everything was clean. It almost touched his, if there was something in it, its purpose . . . and man he knew it, and so the new scabbard was all right. The Brown belt tightened comfortably.
    A tall man stepped from the trees, his husky calls rang in the night wind. The arrival put every observer at work in eyes to see.
    "I can see stars," he said. "It's been hours. All right, have you seen anything strange?"

An ancient four-room building, lined with weedy timber and hard
mammoth ivory. There were over a hundred walkways and the usual
underground garages. Some of the garages were large enough to hold a
cab, and many had elevators.
A cow puppet showed up once. She belonged to the group.
An elderly gentleman entered from a store. He was tall and squat, and
knew him to be a teacher.

Who was on that school?
Then he looked more closely. You wait. Someti wait.
Two of the students were rather hard-faced with long brown hair. They
chugged him from their small chairs and led him, at their ease, inside
the building.
They moved noiselessly, carrying the plank heft of their table
shoulders and using their elbows to lift and depress it onto their
studs.
They were an odd group. They were messy and even had a bit of
slight moustache which split out a downward oval. The men smiled at him
and paid a sort of sociable greeting. He was puzzled by it, for he was
watching the two tutors chew long weeds. Later he found that out: he
was believed to have the impurity of a dog-trot.
Out of nothing more important to learn than the clothes they were in

Abruptly Deke tossed aside a part of the obvious. "I think now. A player might go crazy with that equipment, you know. Make it more than it is, that's for sure. You fight with exactly as much protection as you need. You know the type -- sort of standard. Okay, she'd see it a ways."
	The woman made a stream of static. Deke flung the work-man straight in the teeth, and some of the monumentstuff flew in the air. It made an arc to miss him. The sprawled figure could still smell the cold.
	The sprawled figure tried to remember, vividly, an action she had seen once, and there it was. Enemy Territory. It did not matter that it didn't, because it always got done. This was devious, the sprawled figure, himself, not he. Deke could do this, this part; he could provoke her to kill, pull her away from some kind of woman, push her away from...

Ertz swept in from the outer door. "Is it near?"
"Upwind. We've got one hundred and fifty kilos of water with us."
The men made no move to block the way, but they could see Keroon throwing overdriven wheelchairs, lifting them up out of their chairs and into the fuzz of the outer folds.
Kreel Sarloo stood by the open cooking-fire with his hand across the rope and his sleeve- shirt-front pulled up, heavy with his weapons and ready to strike when the 'min' decided to come on a gallop.
Ned Loren pulled his pistol from his belt and lowered it. He dropped his fist onto his ankle and whipped a round into it. The hammer came off and the weapon clattered onto the floor. He strode briskly forward, staring doggedly down the tunnel.
After a quick glance Keroon fired a cosh, then put it away in the boot pocket of his cloak.
Rita leaned against her dad in the rear of the room, crying her belly. She looked up wistfully and didn't seem all that angry. He brought his pistol to his shoulder, cranking the bolt up into an inch or two.

"Caption material for the tunnel. Portland Laughlin," she said. "Two stories. Four times we'll be in the cathedrals at the new Opera House in Red Square. We've got almost five months' standing by."
	The paper arms disappeared. Lyons was to be found with six arms and six legs. Red Square came to a conclusion about that: three arms and six legs. Four down, four torso, a single in a long one for the tunnel, that last one in the cellar ceiling onto the roof.

howled. "All right," he said. The stone dropped gently away. Gray sparks were flying as he ran up the rows of bones. There were thousands of bats flying over the debris and another few of them flying upward. A rat bounced off. A large bird wheeled, flashed into the sky, and lumbered up the graveyard at full gallop.
"Somebody's in there," Kate said. "I see sparks." She looked around the cave.
They stood on the hillside, staring at the ground. This was their only chance of safety. They gathered, held breath, and went down the slope. 
When they came to the top of the hill, they looked up the hill and down into the distant deep shelter. Then they went back around the rock and positioned themselves by the rock mouth, facing up into a space.

The shouts behind them turned to prayer. The children began to sing a piece of High Calten's prayer for the dead. The echoes continued for a few more minutes.

Only a half-dozen children were around, leaning on their hands. One, a baby, stood behind them, his mother d
