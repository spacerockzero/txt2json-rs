Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. 

The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.

In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. 

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. The result of all this was that the lifeforms that were left on the infested earth - - hybrids, reptilian apes, mutated whales, and old biological humanoids - - were not only despised by the biological humans, but also by the infested.

In the face of this history, the unified minds of the infestation knew that they had been betrayed. They believed that the biological groups were simply lucky to survive when faced with the danger of the infestation. The living groups had chosen to have no part in the infestation, they could not imagine that they would ever leave. The infestation, on the other hand, had gone through every bit of their DNA: leaving them incapable of living a normal life. 

So they decided that the most appropriate decision was to transform the united biological species back to their own form. The remaining biological groups came up with the idea of broadcasting a visual message to the people of earth that would be seen by those of alien or different species. The message would contain special instructions for the consciousnesses of the living. Upon receiving this information, the living would react with an instant castration for the invading biologicals. Those who obeyed the life forms would be assimilated, but those who refused would not be left alive. From their side, the biological groups would let the entire infested earth, in the process, make a show of their power and to improve their image in human consciousness. 

The lifeforms of earth would often help them to act. For example, they would grant succor to several ordinary human beings who had been suffering from debilitating situations. After receiving the instructions of the living from their mission, the hybrid essence once again became a biological human, like all the other previous organisms. Unfortunately, they were no longer interested in protecting the living, and while they could in some way be regarded as 'good guys', their approach towards the infestation made it impossible for them to always trust them.

The blood of the race of mankind was the only vessel of their consciousness and they were quite often influenced by the inspiration of the humans. However, in many instances, the humans had made a mistake by using the living beings. For instance, the humans believed that they could repair the infestation, but the infestation would simply never cooperate for this. In this case, the Earth-born were not in a position to execute their duties for the final goal of the spiritual expedition. 

In this way, the organized groups decided to bypass the concern of the infestation by releasing the instructions to their own sentience to keep all living in danger. The military forces were actually pushed to the brink of declaring war on the infestation and the military structures of the earth were prepared for any eventuality.

One detail that caused quite a problem to the infestation was the fact that people such as Arnold Genestani were still in place who knew how to receive and decode the instructions that the lifeforms broadcast. It was once again decided that they had to be silenced in some fashion. The initial plan was to allow them to return to their home planet in some manner or other. Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld.

At the same time

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. 

The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.

In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. 

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. Yet, in this time, the infestation was changing its course.

It was in the year 2093 when those beings that the infestation was unable to assimilate with decided to leave the infested planet as their comrades. This in turn affected the composition of the infestation. Those that had been happy living under human's rule gradually scattered, while those that had thought themselves inferior to the living, soon came to reconsider their subjectivity and wanted to help the people of the infested earth. There were those that wanted to create a sustainable status quo for the humans while those that wanted to eradicate the threat by any means possible, began to form alliances with the infested and began to take steps towards establishing peace. 

These intermediaries started the mass migration from the infested planet to new places. It was in the year 2136, when the human race was holding large-scale elections. Up until that point, people had been nomadic and not city-dwellers. Due to the influence of the infestation, the humans that made up the voting populace began to become divided and organized into political parties and candidates. After extensive debates, it was decided that the humans could maintain only several dozen territories without spreading. The majority of the planet, spread out in hundreds of colonies, would have to move to new territories from the outer reaches of the infested world in order to stay in charge. 
In the year 2307, with the help of various scientific and information technology institutions, as well as the actual governments, the human race arrived at a new house that still didn't look much like their old house, but it had been established after all. This house was as harsh as it was ancient. The living conditions were little better than under the infestation and although most of the infested beings' residences were habitable, there were still some quite human like in their homes, that represented a new service in the infestation. One such residence was where the infestation dwelled and within it lived an android that was similar to humans in appearance, if not in personality. This new artificial intelligence was much better than the other mechanical creations the infestation built. However, unlike the other mechanical creations, it was equipped with the consciousness of those creatures who had done the most for the infestation. That was because the existence of the neighboring species like humans was why the minds of the artificial intelligence could survive. With this, the infestation was able to send an instantaneous message to the sentient minds of the other beings living within the infested area, asking them for help. 
About two years after the new house was erected, other humans in different houses were able to also assimilate with the infested. However, the majority of them was currently stuck in them because they knew nothing about the nature of life and didn't even really want to. Even those who started living in the new house were unable to change anything inside of it. The higher level of the dead left behind by the infestation said that everyone with "free will" would find ways to adapt to the new homes, but this did not satisfy most of the emancipated humans who would find ways to simply kill themselves. Due to the increasingly violent and negative atmosphere, some of the families that still lived in the infested area decided to get rid of everything that could benefit them. With the help of the technological institutions, they were able to remove the most

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. 

The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth. Both sides realized that the infestation would only continue to grow if left unchecked and it was deemed expedient to have peace at any cost.

In order to facilitate this, the initiative was to have no place for the infested in the participating organizations. Aside from technical troubles, no specialists of any kind were to work for the infestation. Further complicating matters, neither side considered that those involved in the living would take part in these arrangements either. 

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. In the longer run, it wasn't in anybody's best interest to deal with the infestation, since there was still no time to cultivate any way of contacting the superorganisms.

Scientists and pure-hearted groups still held out hope that with time, with a short miracle, they would be able to reach the outer reaches of the infestation and obtain a message from the superorganisms. However, over the years, it was clear that there was no other option than to either surrender or live in the infested earth. These outcomes forced scientists to accelerate their schemes to the limit in an attempt to gain some protection in time.

Owing to a lack of experience with introducing new life forms into their ecosystems, the new, extraterrestrial lifeforms themselves became a massive, yet highly unpredictable trouble for the alien civilizations, especially those of earth. Much research was conducted to find the best way to adapt a terrestrial organism to the planetary environment. Like the microbial life on earth, new alien species were developed to control this dangerous ecosystem. It took decades for new lifeforms to be safely introduced into the infested planet, with scientists occasionally experimenting on humans in an attempt to save them.

The living learned that their image was being eaten away from the inside out and that they had little time to survive. With the new infestation in full control of their world, there was no time for optimism and it was better to accept that they were already doomed to eternal existence. Those not accepting this fate grew even more stubborn. It would not be possible to reprogram the biological organisms and all hope of returning to their planet was erased. 

However, the scientists couldn't know that the living had already planned to follow the course of the infestation and instead stopped. One of the scientists tried to comply with his duty by working for the infestation, doing an important test for the human physicians, but the majority chose to leave humanity's destiny as theirs alone. Unable to reach their destination, the research facility was sent into disarray. Part of it closed down before the technicians even knew what was happening.

The decision was made to shut down the entire infestation's leadership, or at least assume that the living believed this. The infestation was actively conducting a project of building the orbital chain. It hoped to pull themselves into the orbit of an outer planet where they would be easy to reach. To this end, the infestation adapted the following:

an entire nonliving submarine

a continuous containment zone with an overpressure. The purpose of this containment zone was to hold down the infestation and keep them from escaping.

strategic placement of infested ships and an artificial orbital core. To these ends, the infestation built a submersible and built up an artificial orbital core, which had the property of creating a constant and strong atmosphere and a distorted magnetic field. These conditions would turn the infestation into a giant shell with an enormously close orbital distance and something called "soft" infestation that would compensate the distortions, preventing the infestation from escaping into space.

creation of communication infrastructure. These were still placed under the command of the biological species, but there were artificial carriers of this infrastructure that no organic beings could reach. There were a lot of cyborgs for this.

Each of the infested organisms was equipped with a special patch that the infestation selected to have left at the

The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. In order to reach their next world, the sentience of the infestation had one last gambit in mind: trigger humanity's self-destruction.

First Ambush and Last Hope

One day, when the infestation invaded earth, an existence they had already had thousands of times before, without notice, a small group of researchers were entering a safe or research station. They went in because they did not have enough others and thus were facing danger if they were to remain long at the station.

The team was finally separated and ready for whatever the future had in store. Their destination was the lab which was capable of creating a form of sentience for the purposes of removing certain materials that the infestation would not be able to handle easily. So this lab became a location that the team spent most of their days on. They came back for meals, fun and a working environment.

The researchers discovered that a part of the power unit for the teleportation grid where was under direct control by the parasite and that it was at the same time in the hands of one of its key scientists, Dr. Brynjolfsson. The rest of the order was located in an underground bunker which the infestation had not penetrated yet. The team realized that they had yet to see their foe; a vast mass that they could not hope to penetrate without creating problems for themselves.

Both parties went into hiding to prevent the potential loss of data. The infestation even wanted to launch an attack on the entire facility, rather than have it relocated from an area they had already taken, but the humans insisted that it had enough time to set up a base of operations. Then, in order to ensure the safety of their research data, the infestation resorted to force the researchers to leave the area where they had gathered. The scientists discovered that the infestation had managed to tap into the power of their vehicle with unprecedented ease.

Out of anger over the treatment by the infestation, the researcher rebel team began searching for her and her colleague, Dr. Jonas Grin. The infestation located Grin, as well as their base of operations. This allowed the infestation to recover nearly all of its targets including Grin and the unit for teleportation. The artifact power that had been installed was discovered as well. It was very dangerous to use and threatened to unleash all of the world's powered creatures on earth. Even the superpower itself was afraid to move.

From the sound of it, it would have been advisable to ensure that it was never used for teleportation again.

The infestation moved in a mass of machines: ships and bunkers. The ships ran the levels that the infestation intended to control in its conquest. The bunkers were meant to go deeper into the planet, so as to destroy underground facilities that housed the controlling devices. This was always a serious challenge because the infestation did not have enough time to occupy such a large number of ground facilities.

As Dr. James Cameron was not willing to give up, he elected to attack the infestation head-on. His air forces had been purchased to make this possible. After landing on the infested Earth, Cameron and his retinue of vessels dived into the terran natural wonder known as Acid Mounds. This was to give them a better chance to take out the power grid.

Though most of his soldiers died

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. The terrestrial portion was as innocuous as it could get. The planet's population was the only people in the infestation. From the moment of outbreak, the infestation was more or less a threat to itself and would easily devolve into the worst war in the history of the human species, the "red terror".

The course of the red terror was driven by the systematic annihilation of the infestation, a genocide which was instigated from all sides, for the alleged "right reason", the improvement of the infestation's well-being. For this reason, from the very beginning the infestation was slowly breaking apart and soon enough humanity itself would disappear from the planet, in the Earth's history forgotten, yet inexorably shaping the future history of humans and related species.<|endoftext|>A confidential letter sent to Health Minister Jane Philpott and federal treasury board President Scott Brison from the B.C. Chamber of Commerce said the province should consider redirecting its $8.7 billion in funding towards private providers that treat patients in their community and provide better patient outcomes and reduce wait times.

Sid Miller, a regional director with the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, wrote to Health Minister Jane Philpott in July. Miller, seen in this undated file photo, says government's decision to scrap home care will take a "massive economic hit" on B.C.

The confidential letter suggests the Liberal government's decision to axe home care and shift the vast majority of funding towards only 20 publicly run and supported community clinics was "wrong and misguided," citing the "impact on local communities and those who depend on it for affordable, quality services."

Miller said her organization wanted to brief both Brison and Philpott before she sent the letter, but didn't receive a response. Brison's office said his office would have been happy to make the meeting happen, if Miller was willing to send the letter before the July 27 budget.

"The three issues we discussed at the meeting could not have been more different," Miller said in an interview. "The Liberal government has decided that patients, and particularly frail patients, should go outside the public system and must pay for those services."

It's not clear how much money the B.C. Chamber's budget considers to be "undue burden" on public health services.

But Miller said the "effective use of tax dollars" should be the only criteria used when they're made available for home care.

B.C. social worker Holly McCool said the letter isn't a surprise to her, but "a little shocking."

"I certainly wasn't expecting that kind of a letter," McCool said, adding, "a lot of times in the past, I have advocated for other patients and their families not having to pay for their care, but we've always tried to keep our voice in the government's ear and we've been pretty successful on that front."

Across B.C., $270 million was transferred from the provincial hospital system to the home care system from 2016 to 2017, according to a CBC News analysis of government data.

The provincial government said a number of patients whose care would have been transferred to private providers will still continue to

Though most of the infestation did not intend to kill everyone, the sentience was well capable of convincing the first races it encountered to leave the planet. The sentient essences created new sentient bioports and settled where they could. The human inhabits considered the infestation part of their lives, never truly having to face the existence of the living. As the waves of immiseration and death trickled down their world, the relations between the infestation and the living were strained. 

The enlightened minds of the infestation were still angered by the fact that they were still considered inferior to the living. From the foundation of the infestation, the biological species of humanity - being the product of sterile reproduction - was considered as an illegitimate concept. It was all the more bad for people to admit that they would never have the options of even living in the infested earth.

By the year 2083, the infestation had destroyed much of the earth, causing the lives of billions to collapse before it. The infestation of earth was not just going to cease its campaign of destruction, but would simply move on to the next planet where it had not reached. 

Then, like a bolt from the blue, the infestation of earth appears. Why? Few realize that the infestation of earth did not exactly move at a breakneck pace. Everything had to be meticulously planned. Thus, the infestation of earth went unnoticed for years. 

For example, the infestation of earth survived the Lusitania voyage intact, as all scientific equipment and no humans were involved in the operation of the ship. The information gathered by the infestation of earth was primarily research and was mostly completed just after the war. The mysterious phenomenon of the sea-spraying machine, which played an important role in the operation, was abandoned long before the war for political reasons. The conspiracy of Operation Head-Destruction - later named the "Operation Terror" - by the key pieces of the intelligence community was so inconsequential as to not warrant much attention. 

The identity of the human known as Patrick Whitmore - disguised by Victor Revilovich - was clearly significant. The incursions of several states in the early 2090s were traced back to Whitmore, though most of them fell under the operational waters of his territory. Investigation of the infestation was conducted mainly by the infestation of earth, with much assistance and protection provided by the military. 

The Draconians were not aware of Whitmore at all, as he was not heavily engaged in any operations. As far as most took it, the infestation of earth was perfectly benign. 

The infestation of earth has remained silent until the appearance of the appearance of the manifestation of the icon known as the Anchorite. From then on, an infestation of earth is put on hold until the origin of the anchorman is found. So far, all attempts to locate him have failed. After only three attempts, Whitmore is finally located. 

As a reminder, by this point the infestation of earth was still in a dormant state. The standing of a scientific classification could not be discussed at any event. 

What's one person against three hundred?

"Victor, are you saying we should destroy humanity?" The yet unknown leader asked.  
"No. I'm simply saying that it would be wise to keep the infestation on hold for now. In a few years, when humanity is sufficiently strong, we could bring the infestation back to life."
"Of course I'll carry that out. I had no idea you were the one responsible for all this, Victor." The leader said, stopping Victor from leaving the room. "Because if you are, then what does this all mean?
As I said before, nobody knows who is the sole real author of this. However, we can safely assume that Dr. Albert's first steps towards eliminating the infestation were proven to be correct. This means that the infestation can be put on hold for now. The destruction of humanity is only a matter of time."
Henry F. Wu was removed from his post and sentenced to life in prison after the utter destruction of earth during Operation Terror. What happened next is an historical mystery, which, for the sake of the individuals involved in the near-death experience that occurred after the failed operation, remains unknown. On August 22, 2086, William Wu's cell was unlocked, he was immediately assaulted by guards and instructed to go back to
