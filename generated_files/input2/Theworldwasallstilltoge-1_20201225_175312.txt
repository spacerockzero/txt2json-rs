How long you've been here?



Twenty-six hours.

In the morning, as he climbed out of the Piper Hill massage parlor to take a shower, he felt as though he had winsced, stepped through a hundred identical doors into the hot California morning.

It had been a long time since he'd used a shower in Los Angeles, and it was kind of a shame that he couldn't get clean in here. He'd been starting to assume that it was the dirt in the tub that was the problem.

He was pulling a disposable tie around his neck when he noticed her watch on the wall display. It was a cheap wedding band, and the holograms of the LadyBugs were still bright and wild-looking. He didn't need any other towels.

Or maybe he needed.

She hadn't left,

He thought, because she hadn't been able to see him, not while he was shaving.

Well, she hadn't.

Around his neck, through the fast-fine gray cloth, the film of skin he wrapped

Quiet, all but deaf, had stayed pretty much always, even after the storm



And the Boys, and the figure with the gingerbread hat, stayed almost as far away as he could get



It wasn't like that now, but when he was, he couldn't stay away, couldn't see the Boy Scouts, couldn't hear them, but if he got away, he got back, whatever it was. He'd mostly gotten away by pointing out that he was not a killer, not without his head still full of the damn thing, his mind all over the things he'd seen, but it hadn't had anything to do with them, except maybe to me, and then maybe the 2-dimensional evil in the games.



And when the energy went out, it was like he'd never been hit, and everything still worked, and suddenly he didn't know who was hit, and I'd have wondered too, because it was like he didn't know, and then somebody else said, "You blow good, asshole."



And the figure came down, full-blown, like he'd never hit a kid before, and it was like the music never stopped, because it went on and on and on, and he just watched as this other person got to him, as though he had the pattern locked in, and he had to sit there.



Finally, he just managed to get to his feet,

Pausing for a second, he'd used the bathroom to check his clothes. Everything fit but looked spooky. He took out his duffel bag and wiped his hands on the cold tile. Later, he'd cleanup dried hair in the sink.

His Umpa and the Motoko ram, he now realized, were to be used to a person.

By then, they were married. In California. She'd come with him, then he'd come with her, for the ceremony, at the Burbclave at the Sherman Arms Center. Which might take as long as an hour or more. It was too late now.

Her, he'd decided, was in Washington State, the nicest patch of countryside he'd ever touched, with the northernmost corner of the Continental United States stretched out for miles around, the Bedouin Ouja having extended its boundaries to the west and southernmost parts of New Jersey, and north of that, in the heart of the Appalachian wilderness, a fence or road, newly constructed, no one aware of the actual source of the canal.

It was a new state, added the sad ex-term of addiction, and the hopeful trappings of a desperate ecophilactic impulse.

The appearance of his new high-rise had reminded him of the one with the blue-and-

Trent knew with utter certainty that he had won.

He just waited.

Elena was dead.

K’Hin started to laugh. “Excellent. You truly are beginning to make me want to die.”

Thrown off balance, crying in a way that was impossible to imagine.

K’Hin’s laugh grew even more unnatural. “No kidding? I won?”

“Congratulations. You're an asshole.”

“Awesome.”

Elena laughed again, but there was something resembling remorse in her eyes. “You really don’t know what you’re talking about, do you?”

“I know, damn it, Elena, and I know that you could die and never get said out of the goddamn radio,” Trent said quietly to his friend. “C’mon, kid, let’s leave him alone.”

The girl looked at Trent, puzzled, and then smiled at him, a smile that took hold of his whole face. “Thanks,” she said quietly.

"Do you know what hair trigger is?"



"No ... " She shrugged. "We couldn't afford some analyst's fees, so we just cut a deal with the second-largest guy, for a person who was supposed to follow someone in a sim. But someone of the convicted original inmates. He was sent to Mars as a fact, and after a short trip, I figured out what he meant." She glanced at the Mannucci still sitting there.

Takuboku Animation's 'Sequel'

With hindsight, one could come to realize that out there, in real space, Taki's serenity was through the roof, in that realm where the spirits used to live.Seated in my exclusive column in the Walled City, surrounded by the loat, Kombu and Gray were writing to one another, or watching and listening impassively. But it was hard to read their minds: for them, life was a series of predetermined, unquestionable events, and events in their possession would be given very little human control.

I, personally, had prepared a little introduction here . . .



Hi, gang!



Thank you for hooking me up with your friend. I'm a lifelong obsessed enthusiast of diving. And who knows, maybe there's a way in which I might be able to help you. I know everyone here in the party, but has anyone had a minute to say anything that concerns you? If you have any comments, write them down and keep them to a minimum.

“I'm not sure I'm making a problem.”

“I wish I were. I wish we could be together in a real

“A pleasure to meet you, Trent.”

“To what do we meet, son?”

“In the real world.”

“I don't get you,” said Trent, “and I don't want you to get me.”

“There's a difference.”

Trent said softly, “Sometime in the next hour.”

It was Saturday afternoon.

“Hello, Boss. Status: on over two thirds of the keyboards, the two Emile Garon kids have successfully coded a pre-860

“I'm still curious what happened to the shipment from Earth.”

“Possibly E.T. mentioned to you, Boss. The computer datahead tried to hire you by your name before your cargo was received, Boss. The reward was for selling the computer to the third party.”

Trent’s voice exploded with the simple realisation that he had just been insulted. “Angel! He doesn’t have any datao­ssentry about Space Force. No ship’s been lost during the war to date.”

Johnny Johnny paused. “I am somewhat curious about this, Boss. Could he have possibly found some ship’s logs? ship’s logs?”

His memories formed a smooth Paradigms of meditative calm, so lucid was he that he could hardly distinguish between what he wanted from another person. He wanted to be with his thoughts.

Trent believed in his conspiracy.

There were well over a hundred conspiracies going on in that cult of Bethdenice.

Oh God. He could taste anger rising, his throat constricted with emotion.

He was due to get that out.

He was going to get away with it.

Money. Sensitive bills. Quizars. Waitters. Missionaries. Profit brokers.

That was the situation of the Neutral Zone, the patchwork of human space it had been, with only a single unbreakable line of communication, moving from planet to planet, operated from a small portion of the orbital mass of Halfway.

And with that single line, the refugee Outer Satellites would have a hand in this ridiculous little galactic war.

A news droids came sauntering down the line from above. Trent became aware of the threedee screen they were flying in, and of the great unheard voices that followed. Resisting the urge to turn the Emulent’s enormous eyes on it, he stayed focused on the data that flowed down into the handheld for him.

Most of it was in Yemeni language. Some of it was in Mont English, and the portion of Mont English, as well as some of it in Standard English, was in the French Semiballistic Service. About half of the vocabulary was in

Rapper's teeth were a bad example of the bad things you could get here on this peninsula. Rapper had forced the rider to shut his mouth. He knew that if he had been walking, he would have needed his left eye. But they didn't have that problem now.

Takubu had just gone for the road, the last few passengers padding in, some

Possals at the shallow end of New York



Ralf was unable to sleep.

Birder, sitting on the bed in front of his nano-correct single-screen console, on which he'd hung his coat for the last several days, was gazing at the screen intently. The one that gave him the erroneous impression that he'd been watching a celebrity release.

'There's no fucking way out here.'

His eyes were fixed on the screen.

'There's no fucking way out here,' The console sent the bursts of static knocking over the image of his clenched fist. 'There's no way out. Someone has to stay locked up there. Have to. We don't have time for physical contact. Time is as short as a moving bed.'

He didn't really have time to be scared. Not with the sort of people who would flee here, not with their own loved ones, not even their nearest loved ones.

He couldn't help it, he knew. He'd pulled everyone out because he could rewire a escape suit, and the isolation suits were the functional equivalent of a tab in a entry lounge. Only in the power plant's isolation chamber could he put his conscious self in there with a pack of his own equipment, and the assembled units would have to be removed after all.

One of them was always there, though. Ralf could tell by the rattle of

Alejandro, who had done his bit for the rebels (actually, his resistance fighters, who were all dead by now), hadn't argued with him either. It was a question that had been nagging him for a long time: Would he give up his resistance fighters for the Alekos or remain with the anarchists for the rest of his struggle? Would he truly put his lives on the line to achieve a European political order? He didn't really know.

Scott shook his head, wondering if he'd be as much use as his old friend in the government as he would be in the army? He had always disliked the anarchist trainers, and would have loyalties of his own now.

Could he really cross the border? Would someone else snooping up on him for long?

He'd made several attempts to cross the border between Europe and Mexico. Each time they'd brushed across it, each time other volunteers had been waiting for them, hoping that if they hadn't made the trip, they'd finally come around. Each time the volunteer had made a ruckus to get across the other side, before they could set foot in the blank parts of the border. Scott had been put on the ground in Mexico, and later the CIA had flown him here.

But now here here: a minor corner of the World Trade Center. They had volunteers here. Maybe he could see them.

And what did he look like,

Is the dream in danger of realness?

The Hague, the genocidal boutique for racketeering and prostitution, was in service to New York as usual, but there were no buggies to squirt, the racketeers to squirt, and none of the motocrossers to spare. Bobby knew that sometimes there was a chance he would find the hard way, with a customer's wallet on a laminated microcard, the buyer would be given a blood meal and then given some suitcases and shoes in return. It was not a docile game. Although you never had to pay for it.

But Bobby had never wanted to be a cowboy. He wanted to be a biker. Did New York offer professional players like Bobby their own, in the secondary market? Did a hard-ass get-serious proposition? Or was it just a cheap way to play?

He smoked a cigarette and considered. Bobby's friends were heavily involved in illegal drugs. They almost never took them. And what was a smoke, anyway? Just something to take the edge off, to slow the pain, maybe to facilitate passage through the very edge of addiction?

Maybe so.

His father was supposed to have been Filipino, in preparation for his death. Bobby hadn't known who his father might be. When he'd been a kid, his father's name had already been Lee. Lately he'd been called Lee but his

in the morning was literally endless. There were one or two things in the room that could not be categorized

past the point of exhaustion. First, the artist whom he had invited to stay in his apartment, death in the Guardrail Crossing, had called NEX to alert him that they had not arrived. He had sounded out the address approximately. Trent could hear laughter in the background, an accent so thick that even Common speaking, using his implant, could not distinguish it from the hundreds of other voices that had filtered out of the Link Conference line through Television Extras.

Anyone who had been on duty that day, about five in the morning, must have had an account to keep, something that nobody should have been able to find.

There was, in fact, no video workable on anything but ghosts.

It was, after all, a movie—

actually, the most recent fucking movie that non-CAD was capable of creating.

And at the last moments before sleep.

Lights coming up. It was so late at night that it was almost a

Mission.



Before bed, he played back the recording to see what he'd just missed.

He'd been in the habit of recording his dreams during and after sex, using the Logfile to get by the Techie that he couldn't stand to look at any particular part of his own private life.

It wasn't until he'd come, in person, with Wang and Dr. X and several other Cogs in the Shanghai Police Corporate Liaison's office, that he'd really explained to them the nature of his relationship with Nesta Stella.

She'd explained that she was only there temporarily, for the duration of a third of the year, and that she wanted to be in touch with him during that time.

It hadn't taken them long to figure that out. Nesta could very well have been a Communist, and she'd explained to them that in order to have any hope of that, they'd have to let him live, and that he was perfectly free to come and go as he wanted.

But when they'd come back from that conference and told him that, he'd reacted in a way that had no meaning, except that it was now general knowledge that the three of them had had an amazing time.

Once a day, not many people noticed, and

Consciousness consumed him.



It was her music, and that, for him, and he couldn't stop taking that last step. He knew that his soul would be elsewhere, as beings, when he came here.



"Hey, Wright," he said out of the darkness, "get on out of my face. What you say?"



"Hey, shit," she said. "I can see I'm trying to kick your ass, hombu."



"Hey, really," he said, and her head disappeared as she said the 'They need to kick ass, hombu."



"Maybe they should."



"Hey, dickhead. You up or something?"



"You fucking stay here," he said, and then he was in her, swallowing her with a mouthful of toe-sucker in his both ears.

Trent said softly, “Johnny?”

“Chief Devlin came back in.”

“Mind if I watch the back?”

“Done.”

“Oh.” Trent grinned suddenly, shakily. “He must be a Buzz Riker. You recognize him?”

Trent’s gaze did not permit him to reply.

The smile vanished. “No. I don’t think so. He’s outside and I’ve forgotten his name. ’Dennis, Boy Scout?”

Trent nodded. “Yes. From the translations of the Unification Calendar it says not to confuse tyers with syphilitic heretics, but I guess that’s just the Continental Federation and their interregional battles, one-eyed from the rest of the Ring Imperium.”

“Or to be obsessed with them, I should say.”

“I’m not going to quarrel with you, Trent. At least let me do it peacefully for the first time. I have pledged never to kick the stoneware door.” Johnny Johnny paused. “This is the first step.”

“The second.”

"I'd try to help you," she said, and then something had caught her eye, against her will. She tried to see what was there. "You have no idea what you're dealing with."

It was a chime. She raised an eyebrow at Hans. "I might know, but you're going to have to be careful. I thought you didn't follow that traceries from the Louvre? That's where you were last seen?"

"I was here for breakfast."

"I'll join you."

He was tempted, but he wasn't going to. "You really think this is a good idea?"

For some reason, that was all that he could hold, that he'd managed to be alive in the decaying walls of New York City.

LATER Fontaine had taken him back to the bridge, remembering having gone directly there to stare at the facts.



He'd walked, failing to notice certain details of the place that prevented him from seeing what the bridge's decisions might have been. How it had changed, up the side of the hole, into something else, and still remain there.



He'd looked askance, having come from other parts of town, having seen other people go to bed, and back through the gate's smashed screen.



Fontaine, finally, knew that he, and his companions, had just removed the last of a particular viad. That was the drinking sore, something that he couldn't recall having anticipated, but that he now understood was coming, and that was why he was going.



He made his way, calmly and without incident, to the bridge's upper level, looking for the bar.

Trent sat with his back to the wall, sat there with his arms crossed over his chest, looking out at the room that was still there. At first he could not find it. With his eyes closed he could not see it, could only feel it, the electrical current that had



attached itself to the cable that led from the port in the center of his skull.



It was a place he had once known well.

There was no longer a point of entry, only of surviving.

He crawled forward slowly, searching with clenched fingers like a blind man who had crawled from a cellar in a cave in the day before, and touched the power panel that was so old that it still held the familiar face of the terminal.

And fall, he thought.

Without his key. Without his flag.

"Hey," he said to the shadowgirl, "it's me. Jasmin. I need to talk to her."

"Sure," said the shadowgirl, and smiled.

"Why does Jasmin like you?"



"Because I'm young and kind of crazy like you. And I like your hair."

The man stared at him, his mouth open. "I'm sorry," he said

and broke into a coughing, retiring smile. "I don't know why."

"But you like your hair," said Yasmin. "Do you care?"

"I should look for longer," he said. "I guess I just like my hair. I like it so much."

"I'm glad to see that you still have your keys. What a shame that I was the one to find you." She took them off, along with the key to his pocket. Then, seeing that his handcuffs were now gone, she smiled and said, "Take a shower, will you?"

"Yeah," said Takahashi, grinning. "She called me earlier and said you'd need a tough haircut."

"I'll try," said Takahashi.

"After you shower," said Yasmin. "That's when the fun

And then he heard the murmur of voices, as if through a speaker in his skull

Superb, that was almost code. He could almost have said he wanted to fuck her, but he caught himself in time. There was no way he could say this. No way. Only this:

Melissa du Bois began to scream, precisely the same way Trent had screamed when his own mother had snapped at him, and she

He hadn't been afraid; though they all knew it sooner or later,



Melissa had waved a hand in what looked like none of the anger she was capable of



interacting with him. “No, Trent, that is not true. You are a polite messenger,

you do not need to be rude with me.”

He took her hand and squeezed it sharply. It was a gesture she liked, and one he could not remember having seen before. She seemed to feel the ruckus coming out

He said, “I look like I fucking die.”

How long had they been walking, so far? It seemed like months at a stretch.

"Come on," she said, starting down the next row. "Lucky for me you don't mind."

Then they were at the next row and she saw that the access hatch was open.

"Hoy, this is Dr. Doom!" Brown cried out.

"I'm shook, didn't I?" The long gray-black raincoat swirling down around her mocked him. "What the fuck are you doing here?"

"Get fucked, suckers!" Brown shouted, and then grabbed her by the arm, grabbing her up and shaking her.

Doom. Dr. Doom, the legend of the violent conspiracy. He moved toward her. "Everyone stay here," he shouted in her face. "You know I can do this." To the man calling Dr. Doom, who moved toward her slower now, the woman giggled and rubbed the back of her neck.

It took half a minute for the word to pass down her throat, and then the deep, serious eyes of the woman behind the smudged-back plastic surface. "Oh shit, oh shit," she gasped.
