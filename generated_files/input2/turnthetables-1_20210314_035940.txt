everything here is real and the games are too fast, the game is over,
isn't it? Well, I want to bring time to our work, man accepts
the difficultness, willingly or not. How it was in the old days,
that was much worse.
Q Today you are realizing that, in the past, in the zone,
there were other "dealings" that took place there, not
without your understanding and consent. One here
is a fag, another is an asshole, another is old age, and
another is an old maid. Even the girls, you know, the "other
things," whose beauty and youth was what made them beautiful,
were beautiful before they became fags. What about the
fathers who, in their youth, took your father into their head?
What about the disciples of the Baal Shem in Rabbi Eliezer's
hut and, later, when he agreed to divorce them, the sons became
divorceable, their fathers were killed by the authorities of
Bohemia. And they left their forgiveness before their untouchable
father.
Auntie says, "There is no law that says one is required to

keep himself a Lev.·c-something you didn't know?"
"Shammes, everything has gone for the whores here."
Auntie says, "Only the children and the old maids
are still married."
Iwig tried to perceive some hidden meaning in this remark,
and Auntie, like an exiled Jewess, repeated, "What are
you talking about?"
"They make old maids their threshers and don't listen to
boys. In these days they want the new-born to have the
fathership."
"You may be right."
"When my brother was killed by the Germans, Auntie let
me see them and me laugh. They had made the women
into wardresses, mummies. Auntie was laughing, not because she
knew about the killings but because she realized that she herself
was involved in it. She said, 'What a lot we need a second­
hand
father like you to show us who's the father? Aren't
one third the father? What do we need a second father
for when the baby is coming?-Ah yes, the Babbo.' "
"Auntie, it's easy to fall into your orthodox ways . ."
"'It's hard to find another dhyl during the revolution."
."Dad, let me hear you say something."
"I said nothing. But I listened. I was there. I had
been hooked up with the hams. I was one of the first to hear
the Zionists-that is, according to the commanders and the
politicians-come and the reactionary capitalist-destroyers
under a Jewish cloud. I didn't care which side had any of
its own. I was for them. I made good awkwardness. Women
don't want hones; there aren't enough buckets of them.
But I thought treachery! If you want to drive war on
the side of tyranny, forget the principles. And the first thing
you will do is be into the police. I'm afraid for even a slight
thing like your son. I'm afraid for the international situation."
"I didn't drive you mad. But I don't agree. This is
Izhbitzer and his pogroms. But I don't insist. This is your
left. I want you to have to rise up and say what you're
suppressed. You use the Bible like a sheet of paper."
'Tm not in favor of Izhbitzer. If your pogroms are nonJewish

I'll bring you a sword. She's a fine-looking woman, you know.
She's intelligent too, as such."
"She has a son!"
"Ah, no! You came home and you told me you had a son in God's
hands. All right, then, it's up to him to do what he can with his mother.
An old maid doesn't let another old maid lay any old maid down. I
have to drive those two hams back into line. I should have some­
thing to say, no matter to him—everything depends on him. I don't
want to force him. I'll make you a little example. I know that you
will someone else be agreeable, with a wife and perhaps a child.
You'll rest comfortably with Isador Danielson and the Habsburg
Oxenburgs, your mother and father. You will talk to me
passively. I'll talk to you, even if I have to raise my voice,
because they are occupied with the ghosts

on-course, leaving no gaps. We shall not endure the
sayings of the dissolute horde, the lifetime of Israel
is about to end, and we shall end together. Or life
snatches on the wings of a disaster, and death
is about to begin, in the same way that a summer's
week the sun will begin to shine. Moreover, we will possess
even the joy of tasting fresh fruit or of making bun­
dle salt. We won't have the luxury of eating
leafless bread. We shall have the joy of whole and
empty houses.
We shall be like creatures from the Garden of Eden.
Above the comestible bubbly we shall be plagued with

a

baldness of the kind that borders on the cursed.
And when I imagine myself swimming, climbing, with
my puckers, on fins, my hair and beard, I may vomit
as the swans do in their prime, like swans in their nests on
the marshland, and like swans I shall burst forth in a
something, a without, a forever, a metaphor. I shall
no longer have these luxuries.
I know the words that will be written about me.
My secret agent will call me Tom, Jesus, Swift, Blue­
Skin, Uncle Tom, or Nell, Hound. I shall have no name at
all. My name will be Tomer, Jesus, Whitey, Shutzi,
Blue, Holy, Joy, Space, Life, Birth, Time. I shall be a mess
of clay, an eye to the door, a mouth to the rain.
Time will run out and my time will out with me.
I shall know time and I will be known time. There will
be three sheer days. I shall have light and heat and
pain and I shall have none, so I will no longer have
six, nine, five, thirty, two, four, seven. During
the days of drying I shall have lunch at home.
The omelettes I eat with are older and more stale than my
shoulders, for I lubricate myself with I know not what
glow from within. When I am fed I shall have a thick liquor
like wine. This juice I drink is not growth. It was devised
by the Baron's great-grandfather, who was the great-grandson
of Miklas, the scribe, 'the old magician', who was once the
great-grandson of Yods, governor, and a friend of Goethe.
Lists say that he has forgotten all of his deeds, he may be
indistinguishable among the ancestors and I would never know
what I am, but he always spoke benevolently, even though
he did not give anything. This I must credit is the
father's blessing and the memory of a great man.
Time will run out and I will be able to watch as I used
to watch when I was a child in Vienna, though now that I
am an old man my age does not seem so old. Some years ago
we used to think that I was about to die and the medicine suggested
to me was 'truly time' (I pronounced it 'today', the old
day of the world) , but it's no more than a ceremonially named
day, the day we like to rush to the cinema with time in our
cousins, stealing crumbs from each other so we will
be able to see our father from afar.
Six o'clock omelettes on coffee. Eight omelettes
on fruit. Vapona on a stool. Asuka on a stool.
Hullo. So I'm at it again. I must be getting out of
it.
'Why are you not here at all, Asuka?'
No one else was here.
'I make all kinds of demands. I ask you what you wanted
to do with your life tonight.'
'I'm not supposed to have any.'

He t's a bachelor, and he likes his women, o n
course; he can't stand them. But he won't find
Husbandman to fight over him and them w the h women I

S he set down the nothings the e aight table, on a
desk, and stood up. The women w acked, and nothing
but, for him, their eye, their yarmulkes and rags.
He took off his filthy shoes and stood in the sun, not
standing on the l ecture he'd been pretending. It was
gone - as if she'd left it behind, as if she'd paid
the sky to pink the way she practiced her elegance
in her hair, and so that she'd have no doubts
that he w a s naked. No. He stood in the sun, and when
he saw that the women had just sheen ted him old-style
back, he said to h er : Can you make my boots squeak
? But the women laughed and took them off. He
knelt down, in the dirt, and they took off
his clothes too, and he prepared to endure the
minutes of humiliation and humiliation that was the
game of every broughter. He looked at h er,
and she looked at him. She kept her eyes on the
monstrous w ack she had painted,"..and her mouth
dropped open. ( She was perfect.) She dropped her head
for a moment. She said, '"I am so ashamed of you, I can
not bear it any more. I want to have something to
eat. " But the men didn't care for this w arkness.
They were looking at her unpleasantly, with a show of
acceptation. Perhaps they considered her aristocratic, or
Indian; perhaps they had forgotten that she was
a muzarv of a Filip, and now they were seeing a brute
lover, a voracious carnivore, a predator, and they were
becoming emboldened to h ave a taste for it beca use
she had loyally h a d them the same kind of com­
mentions that she h ad had.
But some didn't feel gai n . 'Were you cheated also,
with the money?"
"Yes."
"Then perhaps it is true that you did ask them to
work for you."
"Oh, I didn't ask you t o get them to work for me."
"Why would you do h ave robbed them, my dear?"
"I merely asked for you to give them money. "
"What money?"
"I gave you dre and your socks."
"Your socks? "
"That was my gift. I didn't ask for them."
"Why does your heart say that? "
"I don't know."
"The lady with whom I was to dine a few days ago,"
the lady with the black eye-patch said, "has

wakened. She believes that I raped her some time
ago. She lost her faith and h usband. She is
alone. She believes that I raped her that very
last Sunday, and that I tried to evade you."
"So you believe that the lady with the black eye­
patch is lying in bed with you ? "
"I've separated."
"Are you here all alone, alone with your
belief on the very eve of a murder? "
"No one is here but the lady with the black ar­
mband."
"Believe me," the lady with the red braid said,
"there have never been cases like yours in the
coun court. Not even the venal kind, such as that of a
woman of her age. What can culture be but a
literature of vermin? There is only one redeem­
ance for each person, and that is the belief in
the worth worth of her," the black woman w a s saying.
"So what value should man have ? " the
coun court lady had asked. "Still less a man?

such a brutal operation on society, seems a plural­

on which I was writing. Anger moved through me like funk.
The doorbell didn't ring.
I waited a minute, and then I went out.
"Yair, who are you taking the last bus?" I called out.
"Coming right away. I'm going to hach. I'm already late for that
last concert. You won't believe me, but I have to be very good.
You don't seem upset. I can't even speak if there are any devils
stamping on my nogas. As for you, we'll see each other soon."
"Good, good-bye, Yair. Give me a kiss for me, and I'll bring you
back the way you set out."
"Hightower in the middle of the road."
"Yes, dear God."
The door opened and another man stood there. His eyebrows rose. He
looked as though he knew who I was. His face, too, was the same, almost
beautiful. He was short and very tall. He winked at me with a half smirk without
even looking at me. I was wondering what my film was about.
"Miyahu Shpilman," he said, "I'm an old friend of Yair's. Can I trouble you a
second?"
"Yes."
"What's your name?"
"Yair Shpilman."
Looks of distress flashed across his face.
"Can I trouble you a second," he said again, very softly, very sadly, "or can I trouble
you the same?"
"Yair," I said, "you can trouble me."
As he left, he waved cheerfully and half jokingly.
"I'll be back, Yair. Give me a kiss for me, and a firm handshake. And
break this nonsense. Can I trouble you a second, while I'm gone?"
"Yes," I said.
Shpilman left and took the keys to my apartment with him.
My wife telephoned from Cairo and announced that she was pregnant. Her
mother-in-law was to join them tomorrow.
After a year's work with the newspaper, I could not live without Yair. He
would exchange his old library for a new workroom. He showed me drawings
of buildings in the army. He would bring my old manuscript with him to
the university.
'Tm afraid of the verbal truth," he said. "It hurts me when I have to explain
everything."
"What are you afraid of?"
"Of being unable to write. Of not being able to see the great things about which
I am perhaps the sole representative on the whole planet. Of being unable to
remember anything. Not to lose the original goal. Of being unable to forget
what happened here once and for all."
"What goals?"
"Predictions. I know as well as any ordinary man the arguments to be found to
come to a man old enough to die his own death but still fresh to his youth.
That's why I'm afraid of the verbal truth. And worry instead about the
unconscious motives of all this, which is the universe itself, the unholy egg of the
cause. Enlightenment or all dead. Is it one-armed bandits or an allegory? The old
tale in the comic book? Or maybe both?"
"Yes."
"Try to turn it over to the professor or promise me a new novel.
I don't care. Listen, I'm no longer living in New York and I'm no longer
married. You're right to be afraid of the physical world. Chasing your dreams
with a ball-and-chain. But you've got to know, just between the lines, how much
real life you're missing. We all lost our territories years ago. We all tread air
like a pair of ants. All you have to do is move slightly in one direction and
we won't get anywhere. I have nothing. In fact, I've got nothing. If you
use the word 'proof,' it's like the worst kind of proof. Accept the reality itself
and the way it is and go on living as you always have—safe, comfortable and
feeding the children. You'll get a salary from a bottle of dairy milk but
for the rest of the year you'll be spending your money on all kinds of
cans and magazines, exploring day and night in the beautifully kept
library of the Cairo University, writing letters and poems to fans in the
province of Ethiopia, the Jerusalem hills and and monopolies of the
desert, and with your mother-in-law in a trance of candor and
joy like a truly young woman who has just divorced her husband

the churns." "The minted gimcrack," Zambo Maxim said, quite disarmed.

"You then," the pagan pointed out to him, "and you,

you may never, but never may you call upon me. Never.

Your pal Gimcrack, and his post, flower upon him, bow to

the earth like the rest. My body is all frail so the garden will

bear me or your own, but my spirit lives, yes, it's a life,

one of my first thoughts, no, die, my legs will raise me on my

arm like the rest of the garden, or whatever it is you call it,

there, even my feet, folded up in myself, but I'll not come.

Oh, Jack, I shall die. I'll come from under you, my legs will

rise. I'll be buried alive, of course, their carcasses will be yours,

the heads will be yours, no, my hands and feet both my

mournations, the hearth will be yours, I'll be your God, you'll

sacrifice and bless me at last, that would be the good

way." "What way?" gasped the Lucky Dragon, a small bald man,

short, inexplicably gay-looking, with broad, timid features,

gaunt-cheeked and clean-shaven, and the robes of a scholar.

His hair burned red. "Who's that skinny little student of yours with the thread in his hair? Whoa man, he's babbling.

Get a little closer, boy, don't let him, there's a bad step he's taking,"

the Pagan said, turning away and exposing his chest as he did so,

now he didn't care what they saw, though suddenly he
measured his steps to the foot of a ruined temple. "The price he'll pay, oh yes. I can make it sellable, for goodness sake. The market's all for it, boys. The audience, they love it, it's two hands high, geez, they're the biggest crowd in the Fourteenth Hole when the lights come up, it'll make him sick and bring in the frightful worshipers, Tootsie and every ten million others. They'll tinkle with their rings crying, it'll be a great trip for fans, a real stupendous payday. Sometimes I think Ingrid is supposed to be dead, but it's not so...." The Pagan briefly looked around as though he expected the heads to turn their heads, then returned to the front of the stage and sat down next to the bread and water. Albert, to the dismay of the Three Ton gang, was standing immediately behind him. "Did you hear what I said, the crowd? There must be a class for a man," the words locked in the heart of the Protestant impresario, "and people must be treated twice as hard for respect as for money or, if you'll pardon the bluntness, for decency, for truth."

He turned his attention to the audience. "Now we have started, I shall dissect the great subject. The world is fair and we all have fair curls, the first thing we know is that it is raining. And now the performer looks around, trying to find the audience and find himself in it." He went out on stage. The audience laughed, which is the most revealing of self-control, and, indeed, at least one audience laughed with a hearty, improvisational sneeze. Albert looked at it and high-rolled his feet. He turned to the leader. "All right, enough, the profession of religion is as dear as any degree of Christianity is holy. Have you ever written a play in which the way the world was destroyed is so simple, so inevitable, so unchangeable?"

He laughed again. The common man, he thought, something on the order of Stalin all the time. But the audience laughed and he laughed too. As they watched the roller-coaster and the string of knots, as they watched the sound of the stones rolling onto the ring, Albert pestered the old hangman in the bargain.

"Billy Tipton!" he called in a ferulean voice. "Billy Tipton!"

"Well," said the head of the audience without turning around, referring to him as Billy Tipton, and to the rest of the audience as the Unknown and other characters, sprang from the paper. They laughed with a hearty, unironic knocking speculator's laugh. Now he was the one laughing.

"Here we are, now we're no longer ghosts," the bard told the audience in a low, scolding voice. "The object of applause, a portrait or

with his daug-duhnag and bang-bang-boom-down-heels into the

coalbin. Beardy gas-balls fly in the ods. Fifteen pounds bear down on them. I don't blame
you. I know you wouldn't have got Susy Anne to go by herself.
Otherwise it wouldn't make any sense. She is a nice girl, but evidently
incestuous. I'm a dogg and I do think I've got some decency. Ruthie's
a martyr and Susy Anne's a frog, Thomas. But the truth is, I've got
ten pounds more. More than that, more. I can't remember what it
was that she gave away. She gave me some money, but nothing else.
Her parents wanted to give up Ardle after he bit her, but she wouldn't
let them, and I said, 'No money. No, they'll get a bigger-than-small fortune
for her now, Nadia. Your dad, my dear, is right.' She wasn't like
myself and then she wasn't like me. She was all of forty years my
age. Nadia was all of thirty-three and she wasn't too fat or fat
at all. I'd never been on a very good diet, but depending on where you
cut and what kind of life you led you could be quite a square peg in a
prowling world. I had faith in her and I often said right in my heart,
'That girl is pure cream.' Oh, don't you see, I'm not completely at
least the post you think I am? Nadia, will you please stop it? Don't you
look at her? Will you stop staring at me? I wouldn't take a peep out of
you and I'm not an amateur. What happened in Cassilina in the forest
we couldn't recall or I don't remember at all. It was after Diu. I don't
remember how it happened. But that's not important. We were arrested
together, and worse happened in jail. Betrayal, I'm sure, yes. Terror. I
said, 'Nadia, you look great,' I said to her. But she looked at me
in utter astonishment and said, 'Only my skin looks better,' My
senses don't bother me. I can look right at a woman and number
when I want. It's true that Nadia came from far away, from
poor Jawtu, but I wanted to make her fall in love. I now
revenge myself for that crime, but something's gone terribly wrong. I
don't know how it went, but I think I've lost the power of
love. Is it just vanity, pure vanity, that makes love a scary thing,
like scissors going right through someone's mouth? Or that I didn't
want her to love me back, that I wanted her to love someone
just for spite? She never even noticed the scar on my face. Does she
notice it now? I have no idea. I don't know what happened,
Dacha. I'm not asking you for the sake of argument. I don't
think so. Let three wounds bother you.
When Nadia appeared, César in the hospital in Chiapelo
was dead. César the Swiss Wallach, Max and Maryanne's

husband, too, was hysterical, but they didn't know what the
matter was. I think they read the papers, well, those papers
to hell, they can never be proved.
César was released from prison two days later and he was
not expected to regain consciousness again until the morrow or, as
it was said, the following year. There were no warnings or
toasts, even at the very beginning of the siege. Except for the
countries of identification, there was seldom a lull during the night.
Just imagine, both nations of the Confederation went to war,
maybe because of a wound, or our hatred of the Great Allies.
This was when I went back to Great Britain, not to take part in
the struggle, but to see if I could for the time being. Before
we lost at the Battle of Blaise, King Looie in the Belgian Land
of the Free and the Forgotten went away with his wife to the land
of the vanquished, to avenge himself. He came back with a lot of
hamriffs, you know, lots of crazy gobble, like Herman Gombinerie.
I give myself no rest in saying, you hear my words, you hear
what I am saying, you shake your head a little. You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

Of all the hunters of men.

Yes, ' said Mancroix.

Then we went to bed. I opened my eyes and was again in a chill. I was glad to be here although I dreaded the sadness of the day ahead. I was still in the warm arms of my own mother. There was a sadness as if I were the master. I was the product of the relationship of the Three Musketeers.

I began to count my aunt's relatives. The days were growing longer; she would be eightyone in nine that morning; I would be fifteen in eighteen, we would be adults in the Age of Peace, and she would not come to Paris. The time for being old was past. No one had dared to question her age.

She would have two legs that were her shoulders and her hands that were her hands. I looked at her hands as she walked. We had used too much soap, too much soap. She would always be too lean for her hips and too tall.

She had a certain piousness old maids who were the bane of the nations; we tried them, to remember the names of the mightiest warriors, from Gallante, Ponto and Vico, to the Carlorophiles; but when I tried them I got nowhere, I had never been competent at taking the shoes off and reciting the fruits as my aunt taught me and which fell in two days, pathetic, changeable and each day painful.

She had a tradition of tying a flat rock eight feet wide in front of her to the ground. But on these she had carried her coffin and the two of us, kneeling, had felt the weight of her body come to a standstill at the deathbed. When she lay with her hands clasped in her lap that was the only place of any importance, it was when she was standing.

As I took that limp out it was the first thing I thought: I am beginning". I took a deep breath to carry it. I put her hand over mine and I looked at her loving eyes in which I saw the riot, the whole earth, the sky of the heavens, the mountains, the sun, the moon, the sun, the sun, the moon, the sun, the sun.

I took smaller steps; more step. I give up looking for myself at the time for the first steps.

When I took a step it was the first step forward for me. I went to the door of the drawing room. I pushed, and opened the door and I didn't sense a thing, because it was so small. My aunt could not hear me and her lips were useless lines. She was wearing brass. She took out the key then and told me to take it to the dresser. I hid it in the dust of the room.

I put it in the drawer.

My aunt was old then. I know her very well. She did live indeed, in the same room as I; she added a bed, a chair, wooden footstool, all of it set up in a place of which the shortest distance could not be obtained. Seven feet of it; and she lived in the attic.

She was extravagant in her house. If you had to describe her extravagance it would be a feast to the city and you would not only be the first, you would be the main, you would be the main, and this was her first extravagance, her most extravagant extravagance, her most extravagant extravagance of all.

She hated my mother and my father. My father brought her between the tax of imagination and the taxes of flesh. It was from him I heard my mother's voice raised; I was wise enough to hang on to that small piece of authority which was my sanity. She came home, she didn't come home, her voice told me her story. From him she got her name, her outfit, with a description of a dress she had at Great Ormond Street School in a proper, grown-up fashion and it would be correct for me to infer that she had done a big deal at Great Ormond Street School and then for the rest of her life, and to tell the truth I am a serious girl if you fill in the pictures I give you the possibility. She ruined me as coldly as in an ice rink. It was the coldest nightmare of all the horrors and I slept with my mouth open.

The picture of hell is not supposed to be a stable. Sixteen shillings and eight for life.

I went up to the second room. It was the third door on the right. I opened it and there was Prince Chânney. I hardly recognized him. Why does nobody tell me that the first room is the fourteenth on the right?

together back to front right. My fianceion was, if not
the most demanding of all experiences
as I recall, at least the most memorable. I
was perpetually on guard against any kind of
reception that might have created for me a
vicious need to return to the conservative territory
of reality. And because I was never on the
regular side of congress, I was never in any
country, no matter how small or faraway,
stopped for any lack of work or money.
I insisted on using pencil, a ballpoint
lamp, and fountain pens. Took to writing letters

(and two or three words as well) and later letters
that would never be published because they
were too passionate and full of passion but
which I could continue to letter down until I
stopped breathing. Then I could write poems.

words up and put them down again where they
were in a book. And in the spring of the year
1961, I got to Limoges in an aging automobile
with my lover. Neither of us spoke a word to
each other that I can remember. My lover opened a
cigarette box that was open, as if to catch
the neighbouring flame. He lit another. Fingers
one and then the other tapped, as if through
a bastion, into the other's guts. I was not going
to tell her the truth of what was going on.
I would not tell her anything at all. I would
say nothing. I listened to him drumming
the cigarette into the lips of his mouth with the three
spontaneous turns that shaved the skin from his nose
to his lips. What was coming out of his mouth
was a fine white mist.

'I have nothing against him,' I said.
He drew back the cigarette smoke, stopped tapping,
touched the ash to his lips with his forefinger, and
then stared into his eyes with a fairy-tale abel

He wanted to hear something and without knowing why I
knew that what I should say in the end, along with
the reasoning and the reasons, and all the rest of it,

the only thing I would have to say .
He was right.
The concept of the libidinous has no origins, not
much to do with religion, and yet it, too, is
founded from the very base of mere existence.
This is how the primitive mind works. But I
remember the golden apples of that golden Eden,
and in the first place, when I was still born, I
stuck the golden apples into my hair. I did not
know I was doing something.
Once I knew I was doing something. And
then it was probably all I could do not to lay
my bare skull bare to the world . But the thing was
spontaneously sprung, a promise never delivered, a
force that broke at the gates of hell .
Let us arrive at my present figure, seated at
my desk in the train station, and in the midst of
the dancing, drunken, drunken, drunken forms
which surround us, I remember a time when
I was happy. Then . . .
Then, when I was happy . . .

That day, he came to my office when I was
writing poetry. I was alone. I stood there with my
handkerchief in my hand, feeling a strange, no
longer emotional happiness. He walked over to my desk
and sat down opposite me. We sat there like that for
a very long time. That is, I tried to write poetry.
Rarely do I remember what I remember, what I
remember. But he—that was it. It was quite literally
that poet whom you spoke of, with that kind
of scratchy black and white. I remember the yellow
shirt I had on. I remember the air because it was good
for the cure, but it was a good moment and then I was
off to work again.
The train, now two and a half hours late, as I wrote
my poems it seemed, sailed through the night through the
night, came home, and every once in a while
came to the station with a long, long whistle, like
which one can never give up and which continues to
command attention whether one is conscious or not.
Then, a few hours after that, it started again, with
a rapid, almost gentle, movement of the damp and
glimpsing black train of trains.

in half-ciners these are, no one has ever brought

a casserole the size of a wadu, and in Mekor Baruch a whole perfumed, effemned nation is crushed by nightfall.

The doors of the house are open. Through the open doors can he himself be heard singing:

Abandoned and faithful, like the horse.

—Papa

One day he came into the room and saw me sitting. I was bent over a cup of coffee and the smell of it drove him out. He couldn't stand seeing me at all. He made me a sandwich and he got into his car and drove me out before I could protest. He drove with extreme care and haste.

When he got back in he said:

"Petchka, you're not home."

"I'm not home. Petchka, I'm at the office of the press."

"Why don't you come home? You're not home. The telephone's out of service. If you're not home, you're at your sister's. At least you should have joined your family. It's not I who should be summoned. It's you. And I can't be near any of my family because everybody I see is there. It's not even nine o'clock yet."

"Why do you hang around here?"

"Why do I hang around? Why do I stay in here? What do you want? I like it here. And the sports news, the news of others, isn't bad. And I'm in the control of my own son. Petchka, I want you to visit me and have a cup of coffee and come to my office. Come over to my office."

"No, I'm not going anywhere."

"Come over. I'll be waiting."

Petchka came and I made up a catty assault on him, but he took it by surprise and went on chewing his teeth in his apartment while looking daggers at me. I couldn't bear the sight of him for long. Finally he left. He was at home, and when he went back to his study to read to and meet me he looked happier than before. (Yes, again he looked happier than before.)

I went with him to the dining room. His teeth were chattering and his coffee was scorching hot.

"Petchka, there's no going back to the office anymore. My goodness, how haughty and pie-eyed out of the West we seem to be, and all the millions we could be. Quite a few people have the consolation of a bad holiday. But I give you a kindness here. I'll make your life a living hell. Good-bye, Petchka, and if I see you again I'll kill you."

Petchka stood there, with glinting key. I went up to the man. I didn't know what to say. I was so confused I almost fainted. Terrible things had just happened. He lifted his hair, which was shaved close to his temples, and waved his hands with the thumb of his hand.

"Don't worry, I'm no coward. I'm going. With your permission I'll mail my mouth—things, piles of things, hassles. You're one of the people who brought the cat into my life. Who brought us all into it. And who let us all into it. I'm telling you this, Petchka, because I'm afraid you're going to get hurt. Get over it, people. Nonsense. No, you're not hurt, and no club you'd ever hang out with, because if you do and then I'm not going to fucking take you with me, I'll see to it that your cats get eaten. As you see, I can't shake off your little beady eyes. And you, Petchka, I don't want you to get hurt, don't worry, I have power. And I can take care of you. I'll prepare it, I'll direct the water of your life. And I'll walk you all off and out of here, and when I've finished I'll carry your belongings. You won't want to see them, remember."

Petchka. He was a funny, strong, loudmouth, crude, and compassionate man. I remember he used to laugh at me. He used to think I was one of these ladies and gents who spend their entire lives moaning and maligning the sign of the cross, saying "It's not so very hard," and how it's hard to prove a thing like that, especially by the way he talks, although at least he doesn't do it badly, but he doesn't prosper from his successes, he keeps his distance from his superiority because his superiority makes him

by matchsticks. Afterward, as some
long-suffering young man of thirty-seven
and seventy-five walked in, a rangy boy of sixty
or so, his dry, white hair down to his shoulders,
he was seized with breathing difficulties.
The man who had deployed him to wait for me
turned out to be a novice in the ways of the
earth, a virgin, as it were, with a bare head and
seducing eyes, even though he was shown a
book of English folktales concerning
the beasts, nymphs, and oracles.
His virile, rounded face gave him away, not
only for no matter what reason, but so
that it became obvious that he had suffered from
Cimmerian tracings.
At the entrance to the house, the novice threw
himself into his arms and sobbed pitifully.
'Hurry, my young friend,' I whispered in his ear,
'time to go back.'
So he went, holding on to the banister, with one
arm longer about me, begging for mercy, again and
again, sometimes sobbing, while I, inexperienced as I was,
shaded my eyes from the hot stare of this man, whose
face on the page was burned by countless fires.
He hardly recognized me, though when
he saw me he knew who I was. When we arrived back
in the village he had forgotten me, and was off to the
town. We would not see each other again until the
whole year was over.
'Poor boy,' I said, 'sometimes you're lucky and sometimes you're
not.'
This remark was an affront to his sense of himself, and
j ust as he was drinking his tea the second time, he
started to laugh.
'She's one of those martyrs who I seem to see every day
flying over empty sky. Often I think she is the wind who
takes the place of the king of kings. Without her I hardly know
whether this world exists or a phantom world that
is nothing but the walls of my mind. With her I don't know
whether it exists at all. Indeed I am unsure whether you care
whether you stand on the other side or whether you have
gone mad.'
I felt suddenly sorry for him, and I said:
'You take so much trouble with your teachers, but I
have to rely on you also to keep me company. And
you can see the result. You tell me what a difficult
subject you have been trying to teach me, and then you
ow to me just the same, as if you had been one of
those freedwomen who'd been sentenced to being
insane until she could recover from her illness. And
you lecture me about love.'
'I am not ashamed of you. I would not have
been ashamed of you if you hadn't asked me for
yourself.'
'That offends you. You laugh at everything I
say, you contradict me, you call me a cold old
donkey.'
'It is only because I am not a fool that you feel at
all obliged to say I am talking nonsense. I am
the enlightened one. I think only of you.'
'You are a mug of milk. But I warn you, I hear the
language, I listen to the voice. I keep my
eyes open to anything that moves.'
'I could have stood in the way of your lectures.
And you know, I'm a bit of a genius. For instance,
I've always admired your book about the correctitude of
weight of water and the division of lands without water,
the standard and wisdom of the peasant, and I
would have had to pay for it.'
'You never mind my writing. I've never
stopped.'
'You can stop at any time.'
'No, but in the long run I am going to.'
'Good, because my little prison doesn't come anywhere near
me. Maybe that's part of my punishment. If I could
get away I could have wept some time before the
integration was finished. But men like me have a
holy auster, which unites their lives and their
graves, and it's indispensable to them, unless it's
simply their weakness. It can be been fatal.'
'You're turning cold.'
'Just a little. I know that.'
'Why do you keep telling me men need you?'
'I know I'm dying.'
'My sister, Anne, who had three children, died
last
January from some common disease. I have to be sent for.
I thought you would be less melancholy; but no, it's
the same old story. Our life is not

with burnished nails whilst tacking madly to the boards.
'That is splendid. ' said the food-merchant. 'I have seen your
tawdry encyclopedias.'
Out of the front door, across the road, came the first of the
Jews bearing the tattered banner. Here I went in first. I
knew that all the Jews had arrived earlier - to be followed by
the cavalry, and that the sun was out. But what did we have to
say before we set out in the middle of the night? The
stars scattered their little fires before sleep, and the worn pave­
ments glowed with the fires of their sanctuaries.
In my tent, I had a glass of brandy and swallowed four
that was enough to keep me silent the whole night.
The bells in the western churches rang as if attracted by a
nation of ravening beasts. Their harsh ringing
secured my heart in the dark, and I saw the light of the
signs. In the sky with its a thousand moons, above the
brumous surface, stood the red eye. I had missed the first
of the miracles. In the morning I said to my memorandum:
'I've survived. Everything has been saved.'
'Who did you rescue : the Germans?' 'They
killed two Germans in the street before anybody noticed.'
'So that was only the beginning? ' 'There was no
beginning.' There was a great light in the sky. The sky
was light blue and full of grace. The sun shone in
like a golden fleece. Everything glittered in that golden
eye. "What, then, did you see in the sky, in the Jerusalem
of the Jews? ' I asked, almost crazily. 'The stars. They're
all stars. They shine on the horizon like birds of paradise.
The Thule stands on Mount Sinai, the seat of the sun, and
lifting fate where the earth ends, the Sun stops its ascension,
rises back over the Ephrata.'
'The sun? And the Dede? '
'This is the second book of the Pentateuch, whose first
image I found in a picture postcard in my room at Beda. Every
few years a reader gets a visit from an American poet,
he's never published anything better, suckles, pears, mushrooms,
areams, and dogs. And I reason that this poet is young
enough for me to make an acquaintance out of the poster;
he doesn't write far.'
'You're exaggerating.'
'No. But you'll never know. It's an old story that's
already long. Most of my friends die quietly. That's why
I'm writing. Three thousand years ago, when I was on
my deathbed, I suddenly experienced a vivid rapture.
In this rapture I heard a voice singing the words to a tune the
same as this one, where everything sang. And I heard the
voice of the sun in the sky, and the voice of the sun on the sea.
The cantor was singing in the name of the new Israel I thought I
knew. But I knew he was only telling me the story of a legend.'
'And the rest is your own invention?'
'That thing you call the living.'
'I've never liked nearly anything so much as the taste of the
mouth that sings for you. Then with the aid of a British sergeant,
I let myself be devoured by the Night Ones. These bastards
have a wealth of faces too human to make me seem
the equal of e eaten. And I can see no reason why you're
such a believer in the netherworld. Famine and poverty
are not near, yet you cast them out with pogroms.
So the English bulldog and the six–sided horsemen reign
over your streets. I spent ten years defending your rights.
That was the slaughter of me. This is the crux in every­
thing you write. The blood of the slain is purified
before it touches the sands of exile. You keep singing.
Well, it's time I opened a window in this dank hotel
where I'm dying. Have you seen my face like this
one? Look at me. I can't quite hide my expression
honorably. I must show you some human face.
My neck is crossed with a black ribbon. My mouth
is open. I'm smiling. But what do you think of
me? There is no contradiction between this smile and
that. You're surrounded by shadows. Allison.
What can my face be? A dark shadow on the ground.
What's your name? "Weep! " '

	Louie's rooming house had been a
tavy place and was in the middle of a strange
street, a street we wouldn't have seen even in
our childhood memories.

A slim, tallish woman with a little bushy-gray hair

was standing in front of the door,

staring at me as I looked at her. I'm on the third floor

of this brownstone in a white manner. The house was in

relationship with the street. The woman was not a

young woman. She sat in the chair in front of the door,

up on the second floor, and when she got up and came

to the doorway for me to go in, her round black

eyes were brown. They had a way of charging a little

even though there was nothing much to stare at.

"I'm sorry we had to take your change purse, so

you ended up taking it to the Post Office and

you didn't even have the decency to leave

your fifty-dollar bill and all the rest of it

to me, but I'll pay it back to you if you can

come up to St. Vincent's and look at the gargoyle,

and call me, and make it stop."

"You whatever, lady," said the man.

Louie was sitting next to him on the bed,

sitting in a South Philly padded coat that was possibly

grey at the knees, a pair of grey trousers with

satin knees.

Louie put his hand on his knee and I went in.

The woman took my purse out onto a long wooden table

and she drew out an envelope. Inside was a slip

starten.
I stuck it into the hamper
The woman turned to me and spoke very softly

and handed it to me. Her voice was very low and very

slowly moving. I looked at the slip of paper in my lap.

It was addressed to find a drop-off.

So I took out my wallet and gave it to her and she

put the slip of paper under my right wrist

and she looked at me again for a moment then looked up and

looked at me.
"Who's that?" it said.

"Just be yourself, Wilfred," she said. "Who's that?"
"Did you think I was walking around up here with a flea

on my head?" she asked.

"I thought it was me," I said.

"They think that's what you do, Dirk," she said.
She stared at me intensely, her eyes narrowed,

her mouth slowly opening and closing. It was the most

intimate, the most and the worst, if she had seen me after

six months with no money and to continue dumping my dime

the night we got together on the bridge, the day

after the crazy movie, when I got there and you

were there and I was up on my knee by the time I heard

figures or women with long black hair and black
destineness. But the walls still cling to the little

it! A woman with red cheeks and black hair walks
ageless down the mountain path, a step is enough for
her. She goes by the motto of the N"m, "In

A man has stood on the shore. At a little lake he
beats with his paddle on a dry stone, and the water
pours into his razors. There is no sight for the fish,
but the water fasts theirs. A woman rolls her
head in the water and holds it open. Her long hair is
soaks. She is squatting in the water and I see her rocks
floating, moving her tongue, her pubic hairs, and the
wings of her body.
"A man is standing on the shore and he is towing back the
motor of a small boat. The boat is going to the bottom
because the man is coming up. I don't know the conditions
t.he scene, but the story seems to accompany itself.
Look at the water; he's coming up. He turns the hot
water around him. The swell rolls and the water turns his
prow face towards the shore. You see, I've simply told you
that he'a me, he's me: he takes the wheel of his boat
and he pushes with his feet, he is not throwing the gills
into the water, even if he knows he should. He pushes
with his feet and all I can hear is the water. I am a

Please, sheeroom! What is this crazy idea you have ?
"The tide of the live. I laugh that anyone should
think that such a thing exists."
"But there is a force in this world-a force more
strong than you ? "
"You little swine, hitch, jap, hitch. A man
who turns his boat around pokes at it every time
sitting on the shore, never stooping-but you two
days ago you jumped out of the water and the
clock stopped. And now the tide is going to sweep
you back into the water. I shall row with you but you
are not going to walk on stilts."
"So you will have to row with a crane? You r

gone back into the water the water will catch you, in the

I do not want to be done."

The girl began to laugh. "Why a half-finished business? Why still
running, Doctor? Grown people are innkeepers and rogues too.
You're the one who'll have a husband if he doesn't
want a wife."

"If there's any

reason why not I

"Then let me go with you!"

"But I'd have to go back with him!"

"It's too late now."

They laughed together. Rombiela looked out the window.
"Good night!"
"Well, night!"

"Remember friend, if you were a criminal, every last word passed

my lips."

I patted the girl's hair. She smiled and stuck to me.
"Here woman, you're jealous."
"No,

"Therefore you don't need to be."
"You make me too jealous."
"Who's jealous? How could that be...?"
"Why are you jealous? You were jealous when I was

"And I'll wait for you at home."

"No, I'm not crazy."

THE BASTARD OF ISTANBUL

Fisting her quivering breast on the opposite bench, Daphne read the instructions on the back
of the helicopter.
She lifted her arm. A strange thing happened then. The helicopter disappear­

ing, the pageboys pointing towards it, the hatless boy with glasses holding out a
half-empty bottle of champagne like a happy huge-screen movie. And in the same
moment, Daphne, too, was shaken. Her arm had gone. The shoulder strap
of her satin dress was torn. Her body was quiet now, dazed with revulsion and
with shock, like someone who has been slapped but glazed with pain. She
tried to steady her breathing, to stand up straight, to reach out and take hold
of Fred's arm, but he was gone.
She was now very far away from the rumpling attentions of her
other body.
Facing her hairless head was the million hair on her torso and belly.
She must be drunk. The pink flush was not as deep on her skin as
it usually was, but the marks and spangles on her upper arms and calves
were different. The circles in her hair made them ripples.
She looked again at the notes stuck in a bottle. Like rain stirring in
a bottle. A stain divided the bottle into two parts. There was a
pop with the bottle or the side of the bottle. The small patch of ink
was in the second of the two remaining parts. Daphne, turned into a
whole woman, had a piece of history in her, with her. She had dropped
her pages of notes from the madly haunting poem she had written a long time ago
of her errant life, but now another book awaited her, from the same
bookkeeper, as before.
'Daphne, Daphne, here.
Daphne,' she sang out, 'Daphne, darling.'
It was not difficult, with her new scar on her left cheek and her
throwaway leather jacket and her younger face (I'm sorry, I don't know
now who is the former minister of God's kingdom, the man who is to
save me from certain death) there to guide her through this madwhirl
of novels and therapists and processions of unsorted words, with hints
and unimpeachable facilities for repentance or pardon. She went to
community meetings and her reputation as a true healer was restored
by a wallop of the glib one. The scars left by her miscarriage
toplined her handsome appearance. A kindly young husband
a-plump and devoted, and a handsome man with the soft dark
brown and gold Indian smile that crowded women's minds.
But Daphne, before all this, had done more harm than she had
realized. She had done it with the wheels of the automobile. She
had curved the ravine at the edge of the fields to a gently descending
banking, and had delivered a personal tipple at dinner for a drunken
mother, laughing haughtily at the expense of her youth and slender­
ness and the love of love so that her womanhood could be responded to
with a kind word.....
Daphne was not at all as she had been. Just prior to what she
called her accident her husband had had a bad fall and a broken hip.
She still adored him when he was young; hot blood always
promises greater pleasure than something satisfying. For instance, her
last performance, when she performed for Fred in the Arts Flourd
on the Narrows Road, after the Lutheran minister she had just
been married. She was concerned at first, really, only for the
safeness of the car. But she was also, at first, comfortable with
her jealousy. She had always been jealous about her husband's
manhood, even before the things that had happened between them
called Somerville's population of small-time vicious women. It
was time for her to change the subject, personalities Jno,
fierce, abstemious, bitchy, ugly, soft-hearted, silent and
such.
They were at the n Shore for breakfast. The brown
wood table with its velvety top turned out to be the work of
Daphne's brother. She had been told how his house was, with
its plaster moss, smoke and asphalt smell, but she had neglected to
remark about the damp, dreary sound of the kitchen sink. She

to serve a hot dessert, someone throws a snowball in, and the flames
drift with a group of pinkish-gray horses. The hors d'oeuvres
consume in a glass, the guests (always slightly older
than the guests) watch from the booths, the men puffing
cigarettes as they talk into a small straw cigarbox, some of
them with hollow cheeks, the women in their most plush

The only foreign place in the city, I hastened to say, " is
in the jungles of South America. For years past, I studied there
with an old National Geographic, as lover of no one but
his lover of no one but himself. My husband is a veteran of the
fantasies of the Rio-Sporting Club, the national secretariat for
oil and sales. I led his daily life; I lived in his house because
he grew up sucking milk from a porcelain teapot. I have a great
bachelor apartment, three servants, and every morning I carry the
daily papers, the packages of candy and the pocket handkerchiefs,
double-wrapped, that his wife, his mother-in-law, stole from
him while he was away. His adult daughter, a richer one than
one of his own, had never married and was still madly in love
with a whore who worked in a brothel. I don't blame her for being a
woman of uncommonly gregarious appetites. She has a homous hair
cordin, a thick, curly, dark hair, a sense of the Serpent in red­
gold and violet. I never went with her. We are separated by age.
I am the last of the Agis, after I hanged my uncle on his gallows
in the middle of the Sixty-third, or I am the first. My father-in
law, King Yasser, has been dead for seven years. Many people were
killed in the war. I have seen many brutal murders in the South
and in the East. We escaped from Russia. We flee Afisevros, we camp in
the vineyards and in the vineyards of the Tashkent and we are rarely
seen outside the tradehouses or in the streets of Belzec. More than
once I was fortunate enough to get rich by exiling a dozen more
murderers from terrible wars in China, and at the same time I lay in
a cellar with a pair of children and a dog and ate meatil yd
pial. I know about those who live on the mountains and we
behave the same ancient views. My husband I told you, a scholar,
in a caftan, with a black beard, and we struggle to make decent
meals. He's widowed divorced and I don't think he's young. It
is a long story, but not a long one. I won't stay here, for I have
forever to look after my own family. I've lived with them from
husband to father for three generations. When it comes to the
gifts a child has to carry I sometimes hold out among the
foliage. My husband sends a weekly allowance, our com­
mentary, and we see to it that his mother doesn't get up in
the morning. One day he lost the hose in the hayloft. He
fell down and broke his hip, and they took him into the army.
It was a long, long war. They killed us all. Your father-in-law is a
war man. I don't blame him. His children, one of his any­
days is going to be our sons-in-law. The tailor's wife is our
go-between. She's old and ugly, but she's a long way from
evil and travestied. Our parents are dead and the rest of
us are on the hook. But my father-in-law will die one of these
night. At night the sky is black and we're all drowned-the
wives, the sons, children. We build palaces and we don't
know which way to blunder in. We don't know what to
do, but we have to. I'm not as rich as he is and I don't
have a head for numbers. I'd rather have got everything
back. I'm a householder; your father-in-law
is a teacher in the theology of the Arabs. My father-in-law,
Abram, thinks about the Jews where a Jew should be.
Abraham, Mahomet, his father-in-law, was a pious man. He
paid attention to the tailors who forced him to forsake it.

"Will you do the same thing?"

"You don't know why you're so sure you won't come

"I know why I'm afraid. If I don't come there, I'll let myself
be killed there."
"The new man will be different, I'm sure. In a few
weeks," he said, "he'll be as old as Jesus."
I had heard this statement many times. Man was an old
man. There was no reason why Czarist Russia should
gain from parallels such that they could be transformed into
parenties.
Czarist Russia was afraid of the hatred of power, or the terror of
the law: he guested to match his instincts with the laws
of nature and the laws of cosmology. Since the approach of the
destiny of the universe was a cause of cataclysmic suffering,
Czarist Russia had to live through the wrath of gods and
supreme laws either in terms of justice or in terms
of mercy.
The picture of the world that he saw in his mind, the image of
the sun with its yin-yang eclipse, was arranged in accord with
his need for justice, mercy, and God-a demand for
justice or mercy in question—could only proceed if
God had no face.
But if the bottom line to be had was that of the sun,
then the face of the sun was from the sun's and full of
life. It was the sun—no longer firmly fixed a star—
that had to be drawn from the bottom of the sky, that
was terrified of a contradiction in space and time. What had
once been made—the world—was not competing with
what lay beyond it. I confine myself to the heat of the
earth, I was equally sure of the phenomenon of cosmic
blindness. Small noise and noise were transformed into
beautiful sounds, splashes of color and cries, groans,
handshakes, and sighs.

En years old Pilar and Gerasimpa the leper
came running in a wagon full of broken soul.
They wanted to stop before the outhouse with
the wheel of the horo. Pilar tried to shake Gerasimpa,
but Gerasimpa was strong and Huishin was
not. It was natural for a man must be careful about
always eating the right food twice a day.
They stood at the outhouse door, breathing the
noxious fumes of the horo and the cauldron,
the fire in the fireplace of the building of the outer
city, the divan forever in the same place.
When they entered Gerasimpa said, 'Isn't this
the way.' Gerasimpa, insisting, argued, then they
got into the wagon and Gerasimpa helped him down
and they set off home. He stood under the kettle
with the colao and turned it from side to
side.
Now Gerasimpa had become a man not of this earth ,
not the man of such kitsch and lewdness, but the father
of a good shepherd, guiding the children of children,
carrying hip wings of the thirties, King of the
world of the children of sorrows to the children of the
past.
In Gerasimpa's coat pocket were the first two things
he had so far found: the little stone fluted
shaltock, and the still-fresh bouquet of rose petals
that had once been his desire. He was alimentary­
izing his desire on the side of the desert,
however empty-handed.
Gerasimpa said, 'Maybe you understand, I
think perhaps you understand, that this is a mysterious
way, I believe it is,' and bent forward to put
her in his arms.

when she sees them. When she wants to cool things
off, she makes sure she blows her nose on them before
every meal.
She has a host-ause the day she goes in for her shirt
of course, and every night she puts her stockings on her
foot. My mother is the one without a bosom. She is pure
and spiky and more flamboyant than ever. She has the cheek
of Lord^ in her face and hair, because at one time she was
a model in an ad for french couture and still is. She likes to have her
hair done in braids and earrings and she keeps her face in two
marrows on top of her pink-and-silver skullcap. All around her
skin is a slight lack of disposition and she has an enormous capacity
for giving orders. She tells me that as a child she was in a
bommy: she was never quiet and she used to shut her eyes with
most of her whole body and snore. She used to hide in
the cellar, in her nightdress, with her hair down.
She has a mistress, too—a masseuse and a poetess who dresses in a
black velvet apron and wears black stockings. The velvet apron
was part of the trappings won in the military hospital of the Chinese but,
as the poet put it, had been laced with maps so that the infra­
bor's intelligence could march out through the darkness and find
themselves under the covers of night. It is half the century they lived
under such a veil. The poets of the First Poets, Chlada, Georges, did the
same trick with their faces. But Chlada was the easier one because he
was a boy, unwillingly but lustfully, they say, and he cried for
mother. Georges, when he had completed the series of his
children's drawings, had one of my mother's posts on his forehead.
She longed for nothing but the haystack of her life. She would think of
the three men she kept and paid them with her dowry. Slowly
her memory returned to those three dead men, who spoke her
best in the dark or talked to her in the dark—they had lit a
fire, bent her head back and opened her mouth to swallow
her first and swallow her second. She would have liked to have been
there, to them, to her mother-mother, even, with half-closed eyes,
to the whole world. But she was not there, and would never
have dreamed of being.

There was a man in our village, an old man, tall and thin
and strange, with a white line on his face, who had been in the
soldier's company, against all women and children. He had
sucked piss from body to body. My father called him "the
soldier." He had been in the war with the Thirteen Generals
and he had a whole platoon of bodies in a field near Chewing
Cayenne, and he was always driven out to the front lines.
My father grew up next to the Šlemmey Castle, in
a cellar next to the hospital where my mother lived with my
mother. He had four little girls heavy with babies. They always
played "blind" and never got any letters from my father.
The fateful day, Podium Chaillotina was captured. The cavalry.
They said it was the finest training. The bloody awful war
in the fields outside, the black men who went around squabbling.
That was to be our triumph. Our ears rang with the horse of doom in the
horn of our cavalry. When my father reported that, my mother
wrote to him and he was supposed to get the perfect report.
My stepmother never got any "perfect report" but always a
wasted lunch. The Assyrians did not eat well, not even reptiles.

Lord de la luce cruelly carried out the Chaillotina's instructions.
That was his way, but my stepmother got more exercises
than anyone else. She would watch the men eating or standing
at ease and learn to recognize different types with the precision of
a wreck. \Vith the help of my father she could decide as to
which food took which form of food. Still, she would be
taken one day to a local store and buy two carefully packed
breads and an array of delicacies of cheeses, sardines, spices
that would never be matched in the Chalde's museum by another,
possibly well-known race. The storekeeper would never know it,

with their own fists.
They strapped Koppel into one of the cots he
had made them from sheets of tin. Then they
went along either side of the cages, swinging the bars
like a tag; and the dogs in the cages began to bark.
The owners sat in the cages, puffing away. The
dogs howling continued to grow. Koppel
wrote the sports reports and published his articles.
He sent the rest of my salary to the Bureau of
Pay. He had set up his own office and furnished a
desk. He was learning German as a result of his
hard work. He was involved in several translation
of the Yiddish newspaper. He owned a copy of
Bahl's Review where he edited. He tailed the com­
mentaries of the Yiddish press in the courtyard.
There were tourists with their dogs barking outside.
The street lights were on. Koppel was singing a
few bars of "Sun of Onrèse." He was afraid that the
dogs would attack him first. Since he was building
up his house, he put up a roof; he had his own
apartment. He hired a plumber and installed a heap
of boards in the cellar. The floorboards still
stank. A billy goat was tethered to a beam with a
loosened rope. But Koppel used the box containing the

t

sinkers. He would sit in the comer, propped on his
kettle, and read a verse of the Psalms. He had a
side table with the glass pan, the knife, and the glass
tray. He also had a radio with a cloudless record and
an edition of the evening paper. He tried to learn
about the art of tanning, and how to make candles,
and how to use a press and how to produce
drugs. He found many books and magazines on
the news, from Simkin's Spanish Fort to the mysteries of
Russia. How to steal rotten salmon, preserved
in water, chopped up, pounded, boiled, vanished.
He also read Freud's teachings on lust and madness.
But no one trusted him.
One evening he finished his lunch, tacked up the
shears with plastic, and stamped his orders. He
went to the mansion to do all his work. He had
started whistling, but hissing was so loud that
women would come offering to buy him half a crown
for eggs. He also had rented a little space which
he set apart for himself in the basement of the
Building. Whenever he spoke to any of his friends
on the telephone he was asked to give them the
siniest nod, the least gesture that was possible with such
a veiled woman.
Quietly folding his two-piece suit, he walked up
and down the corridors with his hands in his-rusty
coat pockets, whistling the tune with a sad count­
in, and after the beat of his whistle the house jer­
led like a bell.
He was in the attic again. Through the door he
heard the dog barking. For some reason Koppel
was always accompanied by the smell of soapy
soapy hands. He went back to the kit and dream­
ed of the lost tribes. Often he was attacked by a
bear and the bear seemed to resist Koppel's embrace.
All his strength was used up. I have never been
surprised that the miracle of the Torah is something
that can be faked. The animals part with their own
fancy-the nails, the hide, through a muzzle, into a
whole world; even the dog has his own tent and his own
way of howling. Koppel being Koppel, even on the
ecute, at least he alone knows that only the miracle
of the true miracle can win. Once in a while, in the
average time I had a dream such as this one which
returned both Tsitvah and my self satisfaction.
How it happened I do not understand. His
breath was changing, then his hands. After so many
years I had learned the tricks of modern demons.
Often it was the moment when the voice of Satan
would pause and the hands turn the hands with out­
stretched arms pointing upward to heaven. The
voice did not mean anything to the fair-haired Africans
who lived in the houses behind. In those days
the demons were human. It did not frighten them
as much as the soldiers who landed barefoot on the
verges and, then, when the day's labor was done,
let them go, in their civilian clothes. On these
reels the Africans had grown up with the voice of the

—The Lord alone knows and can hold His tongue, for the task is to get his hands on these reports of mine, as I told her in that courtroom that last time.

—So what's your name?

—My name?

—Your name!

—See how he reaches his hands through the sleeves of his jacket? he said and kicked them. —I wasn't wearing gloves, seeing how you can't see, and your hands are on his jacket.

—Well they're not the only ones on the Judge, just some gone to peter out their hiding place up there . . .

—He never said that, did he?

—I didn't hear him, I thought he was playing the piano, he found his glasses, and I think then he stopped, and didn't hear anybody . . . he turned, the chair he sat in surrounded him with its weight on a chair.

—What do you want?

—Finish my something.

—What you want is done what you did and back to the offload, the meanness of the world, they'll just take your work and throw it away. The laughter rose again with a rhythm he wasn't, watching the triumph of the man who had struck his name, as the man took a minute and a half to start again.

—Here. Jack? he said unfolding a gold-banded smooth sheet of writing paper from the arm of his chair.

—Jack I give it to you . . .

—Thank you! he said with clenched fingers. —You've spoiled it . . .

—I didn't mean to . . . we'll drop these here. He gave the paper to the man in the chair. —I didn't know you had this here . . .

—What? He turned from the man in the chair. —My work!

—Yes that's the way you've always wanted it, Jack, right? You'll quit with you all . . . have a big job on the river, Jack, and...

—Do what?

—Finish the work you carried in, it's all he wanted to do but you made him.

—But, wait Jack I don't think you can work here anyhow, I mean even at dinner. I don't think you . . .

—Surprises the man who's just had it all and is busy restoring it to its natural state when he stands under the richly colored plumage of a bird of prey, smiling so hard he can hear his own voice, and he tries to saunter through the dining room as though his face has been broken in two and he was in the midst of celebrating.

—What the hell are you doing? Jack I told you I don't want to go to Halloween.

—Prisp brassy glass candy . . . and he was toying with one of the two brown packages of calculus textbooks on the table. Mr. Feddle glanced up, and then back down over his shoulder as the tail of the always present dog appeared sagging through the doorway.

—I'm going to pick up the broken chair that's been here, you can sort of stand left again in the hall like that.

—All right! I'm going is the Bible of Beasts you've been staring at, what the hell are you doing? Sit down Jack pull the sheets from under your chin, will you?

—I'm standing there on a crack in the ceiling like I am on the far side of a . . .

—All right you sit down and be serious, it's time for this Scripture class, what are you whispering to me for? You don't sound mad. Who's whispering. Speak up, so I can hear.

—I don't know Polly I don't know.

—Well what do you think I'm whispering Polly you're going to walk over here to the Bible and you're going

complete and then, after I threw it away,

I'd feel it again, for a long time after. Like the nod I gave

to the dog when the moon and the winter sky and

all the angels in heaven and on earth were gone and I

was free. It pained me to throw away the finished thing,

and the old man muttered and looked at me and said.,

It was the first time he had ever spoken to me in the flesh.

I told him he was a dishonoured man, and left him, and went to my

room in the morning to die with my clothes on and a hole half

full of bloody razor blades in my head.

The whole house, my life, talking about him and talking about

him, talking about him and talking about him, was a kind of

religious trance, and I have never told anyone else about it,

so I won't tell you. I remember he hunched up as I passed,

partly with fear, seeing me go, and what he saw was a flickering

shadow. We are at the beginning of what is called

OL :"S B E S E Q U OB E N E

I t was a whit_ thrifty place on a grand street.
The house' s a big storeroom with a three-story
front and ten floors. I had to give the place a
repaint and a few electric heaters and a little gas stove
in the dormitory room. It hung in a large dormitory
lamp. I opened the gate around the garden and left, not
wanting to be seen either as a visitor or as a pig in an oo­
drome.
I knew that people did spend their time in this place
and that they tended to get the old. The sense of terrible
danger that had accompanied me over the years around
the house of this same woman saved me from
worrying and I could ignore my nerves completely.
The dormitory was painted a sort of violet and
all sorts of small yellow flowers were growing round
the doors and windows. When I went up toward
the veranda, prom sky pulled a veil over my face and
my nostrils caught a harsh scent of mould. I felt the
spot diesel smell of the moon, and with the tightly
closed gate, I knew that it was safe and that the
mother and I were right on the land of freedom.
The sky lit up with a greenish-blue light. It was
moving very fast. The d i dactors went about their
tribes. The moon was low, but itself the most
evocative of the sky. It was a blue so heavy and
dark that it had the uneasy appearance of the sky
during the black hours. The sky-the entire sky­
was moving, but without that zigzagging motion. It
was moving slowly.
I looked at the trees, the thin branches and leaves. I
looked at the streets and at the women. I looked at
the houses, the gardens, and at the women.
But i n the city the women were all the wisps of
plumage that kept the sky from its full. The sky
worlded back. It seemed as if the world were
hswirling on its axis.
I stood a long time watching the moon, until the
sun came up thirty-three times. Never had the sky

THE BE U R D P APERNESS

done such a big thing for me. Now the watches were
different. The domes were lower, but not so large.
People in the streets would hear the movements
of the sun, the soft echo of the spring.
So I decided to commit a murder, but that was
against the laws.
'I will give you back your freedom at the end of the
year.'
It was midnight by the time I finished what was
about to be done. I looked around the house as my
father had looked after the hen. I got to the top of the
passageway and went down into the cellar. I looked
around the walls. Each one was a different shape. I
turned a corner and came to an entrance. It
was not a very deep cellar. I knew that there
were some storage rooms. I went out through a
floor and down into the cellar to the basement.
I jumped out of the cellar and opened the door over my
head. I could see what the cellar was full of.
There were rooms on all sides. I could not distinguish
sex by smell. There was a large, well-covered table,
a stool, a fountain, and a living room with a table
and arrangement of chairs. There was a vintage
picture on the mantelpiece. I went over to
it and looked at it. It was a picture of a princess.
In the background I made out another picture, this
picture was harder to follow. The child was
mature, just 10 or 12. I looked through the
diary windows. The jailers had come.
'Where do you get all this?'
'It's not just a house

into a whole. He'll manage to keep his eyes off the watchers and
pretend to sleep. And then, in a single gesture, he'll shout
another time for the messiah that he's not coming any nearer to
our people. We'll encounter that same omen again, I'll bet
on it. The war-goat moths will devour us both." They had then
finished their tea, and he rose from his seat and departed.
Standing at his door, he repeated: "You're right. Of all the
Gentiles' speeches, and of all the human fate, the strongest
(perhaps) is for me to stay here by myself."
"Will you be ready to come along when you need to?"
"I don't know."
"Look," Macondo said before going to bed, "I'll be a
vegetarian. That's all I know. I'll sit in the window. I'll
make a perfunctory room for myself. But you have to
stay now. I'm talking to myself and you have to listen
to me."
He sighed.
"Sleep well, Doctor. Take my advice: don't do
anything for a whole day without eating something.
Then you can do absolutely anything you like and
think of nothing else."
He paused. Waking suddenly, he thanked her and
went to his room.

In the doctors' lounge, Dr. Farquar liked to hear the
news about the patient. He knew almost everyone by name,
and he was the only doctor who esteemed the clients
whom he treated with a certain individualized églis
that made them all the same. It was a strange, troubling
fact of which he had surely heard all too much, possibly
part of the payment of a debt so vast he made it
not worth issuing it. It never occurred to him that
there was a great difference between reading the
words of a person and reading a poem. He, on the other hand,
toiled for them and he, without realizing it, tossed pebbles
into the emptying vaults of the cemetery. Even in the darkest
of winter, the vaults of the cemetery stimulated the
whole population in the square, far from the huts
and cigarettes.
Land young land he thought Good morning.
The window of the lounge was open. The sun hung upon
the leaves of the trees, blocked out the shade. It surrounded
the evaporated pool with massed shadows. The sky was always
black and in a place of everlasting darkness. Day and
night, like a veiled, arching wing of that heavy, extravagant
white star, filled, through its canopy, a narrow, undistinguished
air. Then Dr. Farquar, with the briskness of a
jumping eel, poured two tumblers of whisky over the
table and his lover, who sat down across from him,
asked timidly: "So what do you think, Dr.
Farquar? Just think for me, please, not take offense."
"Don't you realize that it's not serious? You're aping
(glutocratically!) Sutton's book. You're reading with
tendentiousness. Although you don't have my sensibilities,
that's not forbidden. The whole city is there. The
vanity of people like myself, they're popularizing
my ideas. Where I come from, they were happy.
It's not for you to argue. You'll never be able to get

them to change, I know. And so for you, it's no more
than a game you play. The people are with you because
you're famous for having written those poems, more
realistically, you too have mentioned them."
"So they are," said the girl.

Dr. Farquar's eyes rushed with tears. "I'm afraid
it's time for me to go," he said, with a wild glance
that touched her with its intensity, and at once she
responded like the girl she was. "What a bolda­
tion," she commented. "But it's so long since you've
told me what's wrong with you. When I asked
whether you were awake, you told me you were. And
that you were tired. And when I went out on my
trip, you came right along with me. What happy
waking gives me the greatest confidence? What a
wonderful breakfast! Nonsense!"
"Just like the poets of ages past," laughed the doctor.
"And this time they've been being fed up with the
same old superstitions," commented the girl with her
charmless laugh. "They're bored by banality
and kings and kings and

rip off their bottoms and scoop the peasant jug
between their legs, the peasant briskly pounces to haul it
across the room.
Skinny, naked, stretched out on the floor with his fingers
plate-tossing an invisible stone; yellow eyes in five
lens, one hollow, one dilated. Experimental Hollerith.
His lips surrounded with a round tongue and the head of his
fists turned toward an invisible mike.
Take a good look at this : a red dwarf.
"Is that all it is, son. "
"No, sir. "
He took the glass and looked up at me. "You think maybe
you're Hercules in the Radio and the Queen of the
Grocers, out of photographs and fanzines. You think
that you have your own Atlas and that this is your television.
You're so goddamn sure of your own stuff."
"I'll be damned,, " I said.
The old man looked down at the red dwarf. "You're
one of them all."
"Yes."
"What do you think I'm after here? A bunch
of black grease and little black people . . . " He shook his
shoulder and pointed at a human leg "and a red dwarf. "What
do you think: bigger, brighter, sexier, sexier, sexier, or red
derbies?"
"I'll have to ask you, Mr. Kepesh."
"Well, you're a man of forty, old man, and you're a little
control."
I didn't laugh.
"Truly?" the old man said, deeply. "That's what I
think. Grighter than a newborn baby, maybe, it's got a good firm
little dignity for a dwarf. That's why I think you seem so cross
and irritated.
"You don't know the meaning of bad and beautiful philanists. People
wear themselves out with ugly jeering philosophies and
uneducated, incontestably stupid, abject people, and, relax,
you're not a dwarf, you're a man, and daubed walls, a
narrow, narrow head, a cold head of singular dangerousness." The old
man paused. He was going to go on. I turned and stared at him
and gazed across the room to his picture. Little pigeon perched on
his thin wings. A thin brain, almost translucent like fingertips,
glowed under the hair in front of the camera, and its cheeks were
white and arched. Its eyes were yellow and flickering with the
remembered divisions of laughter. The bird had seen that I was
disputociating him from the camera and was trying to find the
least-good-place to settle down for the baby. I knew that
it was playing God, and that I was a small-time clown with
it. I looked from his face to the nape of his neck to the
red glistening-sight of his eyes, tears, the golden. I
ran on. "Tell me this. If you're going to stain the King's
room with shit, you're going to have to do it yourself.
Ah yes, I know. I've been tricked by all kinds of men,
but never a queer. " This time I recognized my old friend
Mr. Kapadia's voice as he had spoken to me on the
floating platform over the Golden Gate Bridge.
"But how old was the Giant Turchin that had him?
Old his head was, how should I say, plate-eagled; but it was as if
by his sheer bulk (a head the size of a house, I mean, and far,
far larger) that my grandmother Grace had spotted him
as first thing the next day, from the top of the Market
Building into the wee hours of that night. It was this head
that I'd been so busy groping for all these years; for the
brave, infantile head of our dear worm. And indeed, sir? What
though I have never told you, I can't help comparing it to the
incorruptible head of the Kama Sutra. "
The old man sat there for a while, staring at the reflection of
himself in his glasses. He had actually long hair, very
black and thickly curlicued around bangs. He made the
back of his hand lean against the back of his palm.
"Don't you understand, O, sir? It has to be a very long
time before your time comes. It is not a thousand years, all
smiles and shadows and your head, no, it is not that, it is
the age of communication . . . My dead

Wide awake, and walked in search of a place to If you liked
to admire the mass of furniture more than half the time.
In a supermarket somewhere a cereal aisle had been laid up
with a dozen sticks of different colours. I could not decide
whether my eyes could in fact have readjusted what
was stored in the middle, judging by the rub, to do with
the boxes and packets of several sizes of food, or whether the
bulbs in the great vault whose sign above the door had
been the hand painted RED and blue was only a dog's head.
My heart was beating loud.
I had been driven out of work in the early morning. I was
familiar with the assortment of job-seekers, sitting on the
sofa, waiting for work to finish, nursing glasses of tea,
in the kitchen. Only a week before, they would all have me
working on, to keep me in. Not in the kitchen, actually, so
that I would have work to do. But in the middle of the night,
finding, finding a place to stand and watch, they might turn
on the television, smiling, because they had watched it last night.
They would see the programmes in their heads: Aladdin's lamp with the
red rim, and his sceptic; the sentry at Constantine's gate,
and his Arab girl; the White Iranian, and his Indian girl in
Vermont.
Later, I would experience the television. I watched some
programmes, and most of the programmes came on with the
sandwiches and condiments from the market. Later, I
learned about some of the talks which were held,
outside a supermarket, in a suburb, and I
learned that a member of parliament, an old bourgeois,
had been stabbed, in the back-alley, by
another back-alley crowd angler. I learned about the water
pole, on the deserted or empty canal, and the soft rich
boofs in the electric chair. I learned about
the heat of the furnace. I learned about Mr and Mrs Tomson.
And I learned what the steelworkers' unions had
wanted, in East London and Liverpool and return country,
to work for, as workers, in the old steel-works. I
learned about the roaring and belching and the dying of
longshoremen as a result of the "conditions." I learned
about the steel of the watches and the steel drum which
had been made in China, or in Mongolia, or in
East Germany; to tell the truth, I had, in those days. I
learned about the lines of sennets and anything like that
and no longer cared. The steam-wheels went past,
but I did not go at them. The bells on boxes went
by, and I heard them. I no longer thought of them, no
more than of the water-wheels going by in the
streets. The "water" went by. The cold was of the
warmest kind. Above the hot, the air was like a dream of
the world. I had a little darling with no one at home and long
abandoned her, for she hardly ever saw the smoke of the
fires, nor did she even remember that she was with
her brothers. I did not remember her. I no longer
wanted to change the place where my food was stacked.
My memories of the fortnight before my affair with Kate
remained as they had been, except for one, which was so
remarkable it amazed me that I remembered it at all. She
put me down more harshly than any of the others;
and I could not remember how I got up again. We no
longer lived together night and day, day and night. She would
always write me a note saying: Henry, it's all right, you can
stay here, it's an old-fashioned apartment, but the smell
of the beeswax and the glue and the fish-pores would still
burn me. She wrote a letter saying: I understand that very
well. Each day was a bad day, and each day brought me
a little closer to letting go by myself. But the days of
they were different, every day a bad day, because even the
dead were different from when they had been with me.
It put the terror out of my hands. I was over me and
over them. One morning when I was getting a cup of a
coffee and saw Kate. She walked into the kitchen, and
sat down without looking at me, walked over to a dirty
stool, and sat down. I sat, and began to drink. In this
house, I was never alone. Because of Kate, I could not

with your ears.
I will never follow you. I was dazzled by your company.
How is this liberation to me? To Christ's sanctified body, where
I am in Christ's world?
No, Lord, I pray the enemy of stupid people, so that I may
not be a god created to see the world made ridiculous by the
pleasing dumb. I refuse to close up my ears to the
bounce of the synagogues, the kayhal of the temples, the
word of the Torah. Everything shall be hurled at me
and come at me, not tame words which can be
cried out like a litter, a wicked cow, or a mad
man. I am the true messiah and the true Messiah.
I, the Messiah, shall not bring plague to cities, mosques,
messengers, or rulers. I will be the shepherd of the
Messiah. I, the Messiah, shall regain my lost land
and my lost faith, becoming my father-in-law,
Josch, my pride, my pride. I shall not be able to
be crucified as an imbecile. Even his hair will grow
again as long as mine. Our unfulfilled mama and
father. Our lost mother and father. We externa­
tained too much milk from our breasts. How shall we
rect our bodies from our wounds?
Soon he will come to me in a dream, a smoke, a flame.
He will be like a piece of charlatan. He will be a bit
naked, his hair wet from that dew. He will be coughing
and raving like a fool. When he opens his mouth, a
strange sound will pierce the eardrums. In that moment I,
the Saviour, will be gone, and the Holy Fathers
naked naked with their hair comflled like a woman.
How shall I know I am really Christ when I hear
the sound of a pipe, a cymbal, or a clam. I will know
that God's voice has no bottom, and my divinity will be
triumphant. In that moment I will be he who was crucif­
ded as an infant before he was saveresced, and who, in
his childhood, was called 'Dove,' and went to school
with some boys, and casually g caed, like a stranger; as
the saying goes, out of pity, out of consideration,
I will be a 'higher' man than the one who
carries his word in the wind. When we die, we
shall rot, Rostach: the age of ruins.

Tlte Synagogue for the Broken

Mathilde lay half burnt and her face ripped by thorns
and her broken body remained half intact on the
road. Her flesh was rotting, and the last thing that
immured her was the tiger's paw. When the dawn
rifted its wings and flew over her heaps of leaves
herages, the deer's eggs, the broken water from the
bushes, the scattered graychia and the rats. George

Streetcarrying a basket spoke to her and asked her to stop the
wagon at The Fresh Water Pump. The girl's heart pounded
werethwog and she didn't know what to do. The
hoarse boy was crying as much as the others. The
tiger's paw tore at her ankles. She lifted her head
and beep. The fresh water pump stopped.
She was forced to hop down into the snow. The
freshly burned girl dragged herself up to the cart.
She had frozen to death, like the others who had met
death fighting. The boy fell off the saddler's wagon.
He lost his shirt. The girl herself had frozen. Her
shirt had become stiff with frost, and she was pushed
down into the cold water in the cart. The cart tied
her hands behind her knees and nothing could ever
destroy g odice.

Pray go to the Secretariat, for God's sake!

Praise the Lord for the forty days of darkness!
Now pardon our sins: for the Lord is with us;
The Lord was with our fathers when they made the covenant!
You may wave your hand, O Lord, and say:
Not in vain, for the Lord has looked down upon us
The greater with awe than the burning bush.
Give us this day our daily bread, O Lord, and for the Lord's sake
Let us be ready to serve the Lord forever!
How did the LORD chose to appear to His father, that is to say, that is to say, to His wife, to our mother, always to His father's wife, and to our mother's hus-band?
The heretics deny that the Messiah is coming: (I am a man who has known the heart of a mute, and who can count the heads of oxen themselves!) Dr. Chrysalis is its author, but he is wrong to take it too seriously. Chrysalis is not so much a writer as a marvel, an illustration; it is not an example, but a cartful of spirid flour. "All eyes are upon us tonight," writes Chrysalis (I am no literary magician), "and there will be no wonder for the Lord to deliver."

At that point, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, one of the finest pieces in all of music history, opens in the second movement and closes in the third; Beethoven himself, by composer's orders, changes the score in the third movement. In the conductor's view, the third movement forfeits its uniqueness for the music that follows it and insists on repeating it three times.

"This time!" Sidney Bechet cries out. "This time we shall not live! You, Lord, who heard the summons and call for our sons, no doubt without any foreknowledge, have failed to heed us. This time we shall not live and we shall die, not before the Lord, but after him. What really happened that day, you have no idea. Behold. A perfectly ripe pigeon! Home, sir, and the roasting over the fire in the oven. What our fathers, no doubt, could not understand is this: we have accomplished the Third Reich, you can have served your country, but you must not live on it alone! Remember that the Third Reich, the Third Army, Third Reich—they have had a very long run. We've been the masters of Europe since, in other words, for all we care, we have made it clear that we, the young people of the Third Reich, are more concerned at serving the Lord than at being their masters."

Beethoven is wondering with pride, with relish, what will become of them all, of his family and the whole human race. Who will be at the podium? He remembers the hands of his wife, he remembers his faithful companion, his loyal servant, the poet, and he even remembers his organs. It would be nice, he tells himself, to be able to say simply: What a pity, an astounding pity, that all are talking in German as they look out over the aisles and squares; who can understand this, the people who came to him with flowers in their collars? Can anyone have imagined the extraordinary expressions on their faces when he put them on?

After two days of scratches and sneezing, and with blood on his fingernails and torn pants, Beethoven raises the minimum of his rations and gets down to work. The Three Musicians go off to admire the magnificent work, and Sidney talks their final compositions into Beethoven's hands, even though he is wearing the rags; still, the musicians' respect is well held.

The Fifth Symphony. Evening.

"First to me, then the Third," says Beethoven, "as usual."

But it doesn't quite fade. Beethoven plays on and on, the tone increasing and increasing. Sidney Bechet says this word finally and last:
To say "you." What does Beethoven heard? What did Beethoven hear? What did Beethoven hear? Did he hear? What did Beethoven hear? Beethoven. A great triumph, a great victory. True, the Third is the allegro about the voice, but much better. And it's a balm to Beethoven's lips to hear his words. Don't you get it, Julian? The Third, the Third is coming. You can see it in his face. The Third is shining with the light of day. Beethoven's mood is festive. Beethoven's mood

wasn't there. She had gone back to school, once,
and Elphinstone had never seen her again.
I sat and counted the items on the shelves.
With a piece of chalk I tried to remember her
numbers. From her books I knew her age: one hundred,
two hundred, and a hundred and five. I counted a book
but I couldn't read it, not a word of French. But she
remained a shadow in my mind. I counted the darts
and chips piled on the carpet and in the table. I
counted the water and milk that came from the tap
but I could not read its contents.
Then I felt hungry and I drew a plate of food
from the refrigerator and ate and ate. Soon I had
dried my eyes and nearly fell asleep and I
faced the wall, my face white as chalk.

Elphinstone's Room
The snowflakes were pushed off the roof but they
fell quickly, frigid and unbending. I smiled in the
central courtyard at the clatter of snow on snow, and
then I knew I was hungry and that Sleet was falling on
the courtyard and the street. I had nothing to win
now but the snowball.

The room was on the third floor. I was on the
bed, ready to go to sleep, when Ruzena came
in. She stood at my side quietly, as if trying
to protect me from the stares of the imaginary audience.
"Are you asleep?" she asked.
"No."
"Did you doze off? Are you bored in the chair?"
I put my arms around her, but she pulled away.
She said: "You're my friend."
"I didn't sleep all night," I said.
"You're still here."

After he had eaten, Ruzena went to read the
traditionary in the magazine in the saloon, and I set
down my knitting. She came back with her heavy,
handbag.
"How do you feel?"
I rolled over, and she sat down on my lap.
"Lie down," she said.
I lay on top of her and looked at her face.
"What do you think?" she asked.
"I think I'm still in the Snow Storm. I've plastered
myselves with snow. My heart is stopped."
"Let's have some more coffee."
It went into slumber. I put on my jacket. She
got up and went to the kitchen. I waited for
the milk to come. Then I got up and got dressed.
I walked over to the table, but no one paid
any attention. The coffee was cold, just enough
that I didn't want to drink it. I looked around
and was surprised to see that they were all smoking.
Ruzena returned and lit me a cigarette.
"You're still watching the movie."
"What movie?"
She turned around and stared at me cozily.
"Don't you want to know?"
"No."
"It's the one you ought to have seen."
"I know."
"You wouldn't have seen it, anyway. You
wouldn't have wanted to see it yourself."
"I guess not."
"You wanted to experience extreme feeling.
Know what that means? That you're still trapped.
You can't escape from being trapped. I'm afraid
it's the beginning. But you're so beautiful and
wanted. So you'd die if you were trapped."
"You're as beautiful as a white diamond."
"So I suppose that's what's so wonderful about
you!"
"Of course. I'm not saying anything against you, but
it's too awful to think that you're ugly. You're really
beautiful."
"I loved you so much that I know I'm beginning to believe
that," said Ruzena. "And I'd have married you if I
could. Your beauty is beyond words."
"Where are your parents?"
"They've left me."
"They've left you?"
"Your mother was dead. Your father has gone back
to work. Don't talk back. You're not hilarious any
more."
"I'm not. I'm not crazy. Now tell me one thing,
because I'm beginning to go crazy, and you're
going to tell me I'm crazy? Tell

turn the tables
into lines and the chairs into lines so that the guests will
be sitting facing to the front and the visitors facing
back. But at the same time the chairs will be positioned
so that the guests facing the front and the guests
facing the back will be facing each other so that, by
now, the guests will have their backs turned to
the right and their faces to the left. The table
must be placed in a row, like a square, which is
obviously what the guests feel comfortable with at
their various gatherings.
In the meantime, the guest standing behind
the table is invited to call him or her by name,
whether on the telephone or by telephone card. The
cousins, gathering together in groups to attend and
celebrate, are invited to call him by name, to
obtain presents or other presents, or to accept
offerings and inherit their property, or to exert
a claim of security over a claim, a claim that
should not be allowed to survive its first appearance on
the lists of the official witnesses that no one passes on
the lists of the official witnesses, should any
other party carry out what it was in the first
place that the party ruled out before its first appearance
on the lists of the witnesses. The main purpose of the
party is to prevent any other party from
contingency over a claim, a claim that is the royal
property of a royal person, but which is clearly rather
principled.
This is what comes of the first political meetings
in Lon colony after the ban on mixed marriages which
had taken effect on the first Sunday of the week
and been given precedence in the days of heavy work
(the heart-of-the-square savannah, the villages, the forests)
ii even if it was different from the first call to
partition, letting a portion of the driftwood and the game
cement and the rotting scraps of fish out, while they
sit around, until the silence is broken and everyone has
set up a huddle. And the meeting that is supposed to have
invited a minority and protected the rights of a majority
to the full scrutiny of the lawyers and the government
People's Court, has no such purpose. The chairman
is the man they call the Speaker. The right wing of the
party they have already met with, the Fine Arts and
Judiciary, was only to meet five minutes before
the Executive Council meeting, lecture if such a
SC is going to be given for the first time, and
make the first public appearance since Mr. Andesmas
has been announced as President. His first
speech to the People's Council, before the first or the
second meeting, was to be delivered by the
information department of the

		The Solutions to Civilizations
Government. The speech of the First Minister,
in the six-hundred-word speech that is
expected to make a fine political figure out of
its present ten years.
The Party's Working Party for the union
has achieved this. The international bodies have
taken advantage of the change of the government in
two years and twelve days of it, and now
they can see the whole ceremony is over, the
first minute, the whole speech has settled down,
they are waiting for the noble and magnificent
representals who speak for them, and all the people were
there before, and even several guests from the other
councils, and they came on the day of the ban,
because palms would be lying on the ground after
polite applause, that's the way , of course my name
called into history. On the way to the First Secretary's
house, I saw a poster of Lon colony which created the
still-clear pleasure of our gathering.

I went down to the swimming pool where they met. "Where are you going?" She did not say anything else, as if she were ready to
keep silent till the conversation itself did not
exist; she laid her gentle palms on the edge of the
pool and walked down to the pool from where Lon
was by now half-drowned. I was walking around in my
initial phase of annoyance, when I cannot help it, but I
determined to repeat the question to her in the same
worn voice, his voice, hers.
"Vera, I wasn't around."
"My wife's without you."
"You get back into the pool? You go and look about

talking about that neat little scenario of mine.

—You simply forget your importance. It wouldn't be nice to be forgotten.

—You forget that I'm sure of you, you forget that I'm sure of you.

—I can't . . . I can't continue . . . to imagine yourself doing it,

—That's right. Well, I wasn't doing any work. I hate to do that.

—What do you mean you were doing work? And if you said it was the only thing in the painting you did, you'd say it was the most important thing in the painting.

—You're talking about my music! You're talking about all the overeducated bits that work the piece. Who cares about that?

—For your music! You walked across the room and down on the floor. He laughed,

and was still laughing, and she got off the bed and stood there turning her hips on him.

I have an image of Moses, whom we have all admired
for centuries. And I have been using my imagination to invent a motion that, an instant later,
will mark out the direction of the wind and the seasons.
I will be facing toward death, toward death and death alone.
I will not see the ways of the Lord, and I will not know if an
eye exists, whether a face is smiling or that of a madman.
An eye, not an eye: hear me: the Apostle has for­
tended to speak to me; he has been addressing me in the public
way. He has used my voice, he has addressed me, he has
crossed my lips or cleaved my throat and spoken to me in a
presence larger than that of God. And he has been slow
to defeat the power of the Lord, but he has not vanquished
the power of the Lord, not in the end. He has slain the
Lord but not the Lord, not in the final defeat, but only in
the final victory, and he has seemed to mock the Lord and not
to mock Him.
I have been confronted by a rebel angel, I have known the familiar
irritation, I have seen the magicians, I have heard my children's
cryings. I have felt the enemy's wrath. And I have been oppressed.
I have long since lost the power of the Lord, but I have
found it again, a little, and it is still there.
But the Lord is no longer in the end. I have found the
mistress, and I have taken her from trance.

Doubt is an ailment that can be cured by mirrors. The fool
imagines a page of mirrors and then he has a glimpse
of the face of the fool. The mirror may be the mirror of
the fool. Let others marvel at it, follow it, know and
know alike. Those who make faces have their own
mirrors and their own mirror. It is not enough to
demasimize or erase the mirror of the fool or seduce
it in the same way. Let others see the form
of the fool in itself; that is the respectable thing to
do. Nevertheless, let them tremble with terror
that the mirror may change like the mirror of a
mysterious carpenter's hand and may be the mirror
of the fool. Let others see the fool in the form
of a mirror, in the form of a parrot, in the form of a
box, in the form of a country dog, in the form of a
mule, in the form of a yellow clam, in the form
of a vermin, in the form of a leech, in the face of a she
of the sea and the mirror of an infant, in the form
of a tiger, in the shape of a bird, in the monstrous
image of a flea. Let them see the mirror of a
brute. Let them see themselves in the mirror of
a deaf ear, on the backs of mules' legs, on
the boards of their stretchers. Let them see themselves
in the mirror so that someone may see themselves
and others see them. Let them see the lens
by which the lens of their eyes can be be converted.
Let them see themselves in the mirror of the eye of a
demented eye, in a glass, in a chalice, in a bottle, in a
bottle, in the form of a fan, in the form of a worthy
nightcap, in the form of a stage prop, in the shape of a
digsaw, in the shape of a nurse, in a paraffin canister,
in the form of an umbrella, in the form of a feather wreath,
in the form of a busy man with his head down.
Let others believe themselves in the eyes of the mirror
and in the gaze of a dead man. Let others see a
foolish boy, a madman, in the form of the vampire
sick dog, in the form of a heart of glass, in the
shape of a fan, in the shape of a question mark,
in the shape of a beggar with his back to the street,
in the end face down.
Let others believe themselves in the eyes of a dead
person. Let others remember the memory of
the victim and the memory of the murderer and the
memory of the victim's death. Let others
imagine the back of a chicken, the front of the trousers
of a woman, in the shape of a carpenter's

too often, and mortify the country as a crowd
scores; there is never enough warriage to justify the
curtain of dirt, a trip to the country where horses eat
garbage, and you are forced to drag your feet.
Christianity belongs to the mountains, to the Sierra Madre,
under whose bare blankets the Aztec nightingales sail
among the clouds. The daylight must drown its ghost­
ships in the sea of dream and darkness. The hours of
darkness pass in the dead of night. Religious art is
the source of all religions . . .
Christianity came with a cry from the Mexican mountains,
and if in the years that followed people began to take
it for its cayenne, it was probably because they
were starting to become tired of it, with its very first
glance, and with its antlered, hooded, dog-headed
swords. But I'm not talking about that; on the other hand,
there are religions that bear virtue or serve to deceive
the sense of reason. I'm talking about later religious
works. Faith becomes life, beauty is value in the
cosory perhaps, but gospel is life, and the value
of faith has no worth if it incarnates a "cynical"
god. The same value ascribes Christianity to the east of
Mexico, to the pale sun of the Mediterranean, to the spiritual
precepts of the New World, to the gospel of toleration.
Catholic faith is error of doctrine. If the Super
Christ—the white devil dressed up like a sailor on deck, on
a voyage without a compass, dangerous and bald,
flying over the reef as if he were on the ceiling of the
eighth head and lapping it in—if such a devil is a part
of the color of the sun, then I in the ghetto of Durango
—the city of whores around the harbor, or
between the hills of Agua, probably around the
river of San Luis—know it, I was there—you're
in Mexico City, in the most depraved part of the city,
in a neighborhood begging out of the city. Then you
set off for something. God-care. I prefer the
cleanser, the vanitatum, the press. If there's something
wild about you, give it to me. I don't care what
you call it: I'm talking about the devil that lives inside
all of us, inside the antique beasts, I've only seen him to
ship a Mexican fan.

Listen to my voice. Listen. I'm not one to turn his
back. I am an old man and I can't go back on my
same terms. I've been living here for thirty years.
I'm more or less the same as when I was here.
I had a daughter, 16 years old at last. Her name is
Angélica Marquez. She was born in a Communist camp
in Tlaxpan. She and her mother escaped from the Spanish.
In El Grande she was born by a Communist orphan who then
went to prison. She was —like me—coming from a
Communist camp in Tlaxpan but she distrusts them.
She's a child without a father. You may be able to

Pardo. I come from a poor family. When the
last one died, I went to prison. My wife was there
one time. There was a student gang. Every afternoon they
stood around the fence and on the other side of the fence
there was a sign. And there was a sign about a rich
woman. But I credited the rich lady's gate, of all
things, the sign that said poor people, poor women,
poor children. And that's how I met Amélica
Marquez.
She was the daughter of her father's lawyer. She was
a very beautiful girl. Her father loved her and he
was jealous because he manipulated her -poverty, I said. But I wasn't jealous of anything (though I was
oblivious to beauty). Amélica, María, was the oldest
daughter of my friends. There was also a foster

on the side and in the middle of the pool they hit me. I put a
piece of wood to the puncture.
The woodsmen's laughter rang out a long way up the hill, and
when I heard that, the way the twang of a quaver in a hay
could end up in my ear, I knew where I was. I was on
[7I5
the basket rimmed with brown reeds at that moment, and my
leafs shone all different colors. When a gust lifted the
spread of leaves a few flowers would fly off, and the wind
would have given them a lovely winter's-horn, as pale
and brittle as walnuttree. It was all there with me; a great
dark blanket of feathers hanging on the sky, and everything
moving but my legs and face like that deep wet sea. I
couldn't have dreamed of arms like that, and when I fell
down, my face, kissed upon, warm and good like a
spoon, with no wounds, no bruises, was like a sponge
that penetrated my flesh, my face, what my lips
contacted, into every part of me, and even the breath
that blew through.
That snow is carrying me along now, on its wings,
tears in its cape. Not like a cartoon snow, coming down
on line and taking to the sea, and then ruining your eyes
in it. Snow. The snow as ice.

Man

From the innermost strata of the earth, Man is now
delaying his presence.
Neighbours, you're out there, in the woods like the trees
but you don't belong there. You've crossed your father with
your mother with vinegoons, sucking cherries and
icing them, plucking those from a tree in the middle of
your mother's garden. To you, a thick trunk, a tender branch
above your eye; your mother, almost too fat and long;
her face too round, her smile warm and tear-shaped,
clear circles of makeup like violet polish on her cheeks.
They'd put a picture on the gates, pictured a shepherd boy
carrying a red basket, waving a gold spoon in the
midst of the evening, blind, deaf, and the fogs would
answer him. So, they'd answer: 'Child! Child! The red
brass spoon! Right down to the water! You could have
seen it! It still cuts right through your mouth, but then
you'd think, You're a child! You're so old you must be
adopted, maybe?'

Children are natural intruders.

A good child will lead out moments later.
Now you're going somewhere to walk.

I don't want my mother to be on my back all the time.
That's what she'd come for; all of a sudden she'd
change in a hurry and leave me.
I'm a man. My body, my present afflictions,
my cheeks, my hair, my ears, my whole skin,
my nose, my eyes; yet I am still myself, and not a man. I
don't talk a lot. I write. I do the editorial.
The passions are all there, in my four walls. That's
what I'm saying to you, child. And I don't know you.
Not like you, not yet. I'm trying. I tell myself I'm a
person, but as soon as I see you I can't believe it.
I am not a man, I'm not a man. I don't want to be like
you.
I 'll try again. I'm a man, a real man, not a man. I have
a family, a wife, and it's almost time for you to
go to school. I hold it together from the ground. I leave
my body, I don't let anybody menace me, or if I do,
you smile at me and think I don't know you. When I'm
not with you, with your family or your work, I am full of a
sense of myself, sure as a heartache. It's time. You're
right, it's time, ever since I went to work for the railway
company, you know, hurrying like cats, like dogs,
working as hard as two dozen children. Every morning,
there's a worker. I'm not like them, at all. I know what to
look out for and I've never been in a place where I didn't
know what to look out for. You understand?

I don't like that kind of work.

I know. I.

Steps, bangs. One little bang, and you're off.

over the sideboard. Chan Larry rolled himself from his chair
and freshened his cigar before going out. As he finished, he said, 'I think
we'll have another drink in about fifteen minutes.'
Jewel nodded and picked up a half-empty glass and stuck it into
his mouth.
Ransom looked at him over the rim of the empty glass. 'Have you been out
loughs like this before?'
'Not since the fishwives in the fishloggers' camp in north Africa.

are kept in a metal cage, door to door. You'd feel it with the taste of
it upon your lips and nearly in your throat. You understand why the fishermen
are so careless about the fish.'
Ransom opened his eyes. He felt the cold tiles of the swimming pool settling
with a soft rustle under his palms. The cold streaks of ceiling light were
the mottled patterns of the plexigaming membrane. 'Is there a goldbarrel
around?'
'Orotund.' S.J.'s eyes glittered. 'That's a good one. Almost as if
there were gold in all the sand and the fish couldn't see.' He flicked the ash
from his cigar into the pool below the bar. 'Not a fortune tonight.
You enjoy those baths?'
Ransom shivered. 'I'm afraid I'm not much of a swim man.'
'Even your face is better. You're a strange man, aren't you? All
sorts of things, I'd say. A madman, perhaps.'
Ransom nodded, drained his glass. 'Is Aragon one?'
'One of the others. He's probably the only man who lived to wipe the
basins. S.J.'s men were out all the time.' S.J frowned over his
gold and silver bars, as if conceding to himself that they would
in no way be kissed. 'This man's staying in the cage all the year,
you'd hardly notice.' S.J tapped his gold barter on the rim
of his cup. 'Exhausts his lungs on every day. One summer
he's out six days and six nights without a shiver, and finally
he gets sick enough to die. Then he sits in a pool and
dreams of the fishwomen. The desert seems to be everywhere.
Now, when we were children, we went out on the beach
every day with a handful of sand in our hands. We died so
easily you'd think the salt had gone all my way. There was no
use to clean up after us. We used our fingertips, our nails.
- we knew none of those persons we killed.'
Ransom nodded. He thought of the city of the salt-box hotels,
with its bandaged butts, and its few wrecked car-crashes.
Perhaps he was right? 'I mean,' he said, 'how did I strike this
city?'
'By learning his trade. You can't lose a tout like that.' He
curled his thin lips at the tip. 'One day he comes out of the
basin, eyes down and you're almost comfless. Imagined by a beautiful
woman, quite naked, racing in and out of the pool, her arse pale and
freckled in the salt water. Too chaste for me, too dangerous for
her. Who knows? Maybe she's a millionaire in some other
country. Or no? She's a plump, lively woman, and a mischief
goer. I can't lose my temper with her, I can only admire
her in her own terms. Some evenings I find myself nearing
love. She's a tough one,' S.J. added, as if revealing a
secret. 'She've done you both a favor. You've got your clothes on
for her. Well . . . they're very unpleasant swimsuits.
But you'll have to swim long enough.'
'Did you swim?' Ransom watched him carefully. 'The swim,
all right. But right now I'm not swimming. You do understand
that?'
S.J nodded. 'You're right. And now, you mustn't imagine
that this is a swimming-pool,' he said, turning to the bar. He was
just smiling at Ransom, who took a last steadying sip at the
coughdroker and removed the fire-boil from his tumbler.
'I must admit that the place is pretty impressive. I'd as well
have been at sea. D'you think I haven't seen one of them since I

The plane plunged down the beach and began to pound on the empty runway, and as the banging pounded and rattled this new news travelled to the heart of her immense soul, the lightning raged further, as the giant to whom it had been sent rose up from the sea.

As the light of the sea to which Janet had come descended, he told her everything.

She never saw him again and he never forgave her.

The golden gates of heaven were opened to give her her freedom.

She went back to her husband's house in the desert and waited for him.

They lived in the same house. March the following week Mrs. Friend's car flew into the air over Gilboa, and were propelled to the ground by the force of a jet. Mrs. Friend's dolorous husband said he would never forgive her, but at least the wind didn't blow through the apartment, for he was right on the tarmac of the massive airport.

She, Janet, moved into the house on Perry Place, in (provisions six months old) the best apartment in the world, because I won't sell anything Imba said.

Janet didn't see her garden.

Janet was on the verge of writing another letter, but instead reached for her toothbrush and brushed up and down her teeth with a piece of toilet paper. Enjoy the moment, she said.

She was where she was supposed to be.

It was time to put away childish things, to put away childish songs. She found a black cat staring into a lurid, mirror ball. She brushed off her teeth with a bit of toilet paper and found in the toilet tray for her lipstick, pearl, and a bouquet of roses.

She went out and strode across the lawn's warm sand mixed with shrubs, over the water's edge, and killed two birds. An animal cry cracked in the trees and fell, a dog barked and barked, a bird broke out in song, and this was it.

I want you to protect me from my life:

it's too big, it'll have you

On aDo, and the Imp until

The Beachh at Guya

Before leaving the office after lunch, I could not resist glancing at my watch and found I had a ten-minute wait: five. Yet it seemed only five and would make me very impatient to leave, and not for the penultimate time, since at last, too, I had time to get ready.

I thought of venting my feelings of loneliness, wanting to be by someone, with somebody, perhaps; but I knew where it would lead and there was nothing I could do but wait. And then a strange despair, the inspiration to end all surmises, came over me: I had not been through another such crisis in the last twenty-three years. It was as though I were having a vise parcait for the first time, and had just performed a little service: the first act, with unaided skill. I padded to my room, cast a final gulp of rum in the basin, and left.

I walked along the pavement, and did not know what to do next. At the corner I looked up, back towards the house, and saw a tall thin young man staring at me. A stranger. He was not a stranger: they had met for the first time, on first meeting for the first time. It had been a very long time. Two days ago, when I went to lunch with the subject family, the room where the meeting had taken place was empty. But as always, that was not the only hour I had had to go, because I wanted to believe that, if I retained my wits, the meeting was not altogether unexpected. For at that lunch I had set out to see if it would be possible to arrange another. It was a fait accompli, I had realised, since as we would not let the subject family have anything to do with us and as a result the whole entity seemed less important to the house. But I had not yet made any real conscious decision about it, for whom was I supposing it was to be gained?

Tonight, I was not to set out. I had gone back again, insisting that someone come. And now I've got to go back again, I thought. I raised my knees and walked forward, looking for some obstacle in the road. But it was no obstacle: the man was walking towards me. He got there at the same moment, but far from slowing down: he got past me and came right into my arms. He did not make any sudden movements; he followed the movement of my arms unconsciously, as if he had no awareness. As I looked for something to be strong enough, I heard him say one word, a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, a seventh, a seventh; then after that I could see him only as a blur; and it was only from this that the language of our interests (all of them, that is: the sort of speech, the whole of modern political discourse) was able to step forward; for I had learned it, in spite of all my reservations. But none of this proved, nor could, take my mind off to desert, and I had to obey.

And so we stood there, side by side, for a long time, not saying anything. It was a "long time". And it grew more and more impossible and absurd, I had to do it, twice, three times. It was perfectly clear that he would not take me for one of the family.

Truly it seemed to me that neither of us understood what the other was doing. I could not understand this desire that I devoted so much of my energy, all my time, to the social game of the house, to various idiotic games of dance and play-things, and I could not understand why he acted as I did, as if he were dealing with a child. I saw in his face (which I could not at first identify by eye) the desire to laugh, and I saw his shattered lower lip (which I said was red, I noticed, because it was the last thing I noticed then), so that for a moment I thought he was smiling, but then it disappeared, and I realized that he was utterly serious. He explained to me, all at once, that following the signal received on the telephone in an underworld meeting, he had a secret's worth of several thousand pounds, and that he had envied the many millionaires who, like him, had bought the page of Korukovskaya-Miralya off a corpse. He said that he had heard that these were the richest in Russia. Then I saw that he had a serious task ahead of him, and I did not know what it was.
Once I went to the so-called Western Table and saw the doctor sitting across the table from me, his round blue eyes looking down at

Milan was laughed at because he called it the

banale world. Beside him the girl rolled a cigarette after her.

Far away in the mountains a peasant wagon began to turn a somber horse

into a carriage; at the sides of the wagon a horseman walked.

Milan went to the window and leaned out. There was a policeman with a plate of

stones in his hand.

'Do you realize what it is you've done?' he asked in a low, suspicious voice.

Milan did not answer. The policeman took his own empty pipe from the
bedside drawer and lit it.

'So that's the way,' said the policeman. 'The peasants would start

to fret if you wouldn't take the last two and a half your liberty.'

'They don't understand, they don't know what you mean.'

'No. In fact they don't know what you mean. That's the way of honesty I say.'

'? Fight like hell you'll get something out of it. I'm telling you Columbine, do you think me

a coward when I say my main aim is the destruction of the dying?'

'I don't know,' said the girl.

'But it doesn't bother you? I'm telling you. It's not your fault that you're

saved so that people might take a certain pleasure in the sight of a dead

horse. But if you want to know the truth, in this life you shall need all the

opportunities you need.'

'No.'

'Then let's go.'

The two horses jumped and clanged out of the courtyard. As they

passed the house, a group of quarrelling children set them to quarrelling about

the horses with cries and shouts. In the house, the men laughed again.

Meanwhile, five of us sat down to supper at the table and in and out the house and

the following days there was an occasional visit from our neighbours, who would
telephone from their houses, or, if we went in for a little chat, we listened to

the telephone records of the houses where our group was staying.

In the evening, when the group met to drink a bottle of brandy and discuss the

events of the day, it was almost always the same people who

disappeared immediately, either out of the country or with friends.

As for the library, it was manned by two of the staff and always

two books to be checked and a copy of each of them sent out,

from the Soviet Union, in writing to the Soviet government.

We, in the hope of finding a pretext to be away a long time,

attracted the attention of the police and his wife, who, whenever

she was home, would call a police detective. She showed us the

caretaker's receipt of the receipts, and the apartment's telephone

bill.

'Thank God it's not the representative of X's Hotel,' said one of them at

length.

'Yes, it's true: it's the main building, but of course it isn't the main house. In

every case the priest's marriage was annulled and the men say the two of you always

went to the same hotel. They'll never go back to our town again, you know

1 a person who's inside the building, in the days when there was a

mountain and may even have stayed there some decades since,

and even if they can't stomach the one I saw there, at least they'll

have a bathroom or a television. Don't you agree? After all, I've seen them

two over and they'll be back before us.'

For a week there was routine imprisonment. People on the other side of
the small balcony watched the company pass through the gate on

its way out.

There was a long line of men waiting outside the post office and a line

of women at the café table. The sun when the noon evening

dawned over the site was suddenly a different colour, there was suddenly

something that was foreign in the air. This is what time has come to.
Alas, during the first few days, the political police. one by one,

they returned the books. By now, the city's conservative press

was reconsidering its newspaper account of events and making

an effort to see into its affairs

Luke, by contrast, had the better of the house. He
wrote very thin, almost indecipherable compositions,
tiptoeing across the lines down between the lines,
occasionally playing around the edges, however.
He perfected a kind of music which, as I said,
made him look like a
studio artist, but which was, of course, no
use to anybody. And yet he himself was
afraid of him.
So I know I have this manuscript, nailed up and
typed, stapled, always and forever, so that his
mementoes are never missed: the men on the other side
of the grave, one of them at least.
I have taken the previous files with me wherever I
go. I see them whenever I go to a set of rooms,
and I interrupt at any chance to remark that, although
you've got the place tidy, you've left the men's
room a mess. I don't even write letters anymore. Writing
lies for me, I'll sign my own name williflor.

TODAY I DID THINGS with success. I'm with The
Sea-Tac, sitting, writing, playing. "I'm bored.
My life is a mess." So I got up and knocked. Theatres. Theden of the house is an
actural place, easy to understand. The soldiers in Hounslow, when they came,
seen the generals sitting, their face frowning and glaring. And
the Academicians, who didn't do much but shut
what they had done out of the walls, and lay in the
camps.
There's a small group of men, the oldest I've ever seen,
a sergeant, a corporal, all in uniform, all of them, in
plain clothes. But they're not soldiers, not at all. They are
scytables, useless.
There's a man in uniform in the mess, sitting in the
pantry, the smoking and talking. He's not like the others.
It's

snappy.

I think that the Corporal

takes one of The Commuter's

weapons and pushes him off the table. He's a pretty good soldier,
though he's not a good corporal or anything like that. He
lives far from any other soldier. I can see the Corporal and The
Commuter right before me, ahead of me, leaning
against the wall. It's a strange sight, like pictures I used to
dream when I was small. No, the image is wrong and it
is, though I've heard of pictures when I was small,
almost nothing.
There's a wound on The Commuter's forehead, right on
the other side of the wall there. He's overdoing it.

There's no need to move all the places up and down,
there's no need to move the two Mercs together,
here, over there, the end of The Coast, and all of us,
throughout, don't even think about it.
I am writing this to you and I have a soundtrack, a keyhole, an image. Not a picture like this "night of the
ravellers." A full orchestra. The musicians are like that.

That's all right with me.

"I'm going down now."

"I've got to see to things."
"You can watch upstairs."
"I can't go downstairs. I think it's too low."
"It's my fault, it's mine, I'm the one who's
going. Go downstairs and play with us. That way we
would stop the noise and get behind the table and
sleep. Enough. Fuck you, Emma."
She sat there silently for a while, her back to me as she
played the tune and then let it out a little and play it
over. Then she hit me and set my hand on hers. We
played through it together in gentle subtle movements, hands on
one another.
Then I hit her, hard.
She had just finished the scales and curved it again and
held it, facing me, arms and shoulders bent as she went
back into the kitchen to wash clothes and ready for the next
day's work at The Sea-Tac and, as usual, everyone in the
room.
I had no sound for my hand. Emma's fingers
touched mine as lightly as if she had no flesh; she had

from their legs and cook them in a trumpeting denunciation of the Almighty's

porthole out in the wind. 'Porthole, nuisance, woodcock, hypocrite, pig's-tail.'

Odd as was the way this Old Testament caressing was wrought to the whole world, the words echoed back at me
clear as any from the bird song. Perhaps it was all a custom of the sports and courts, old JK hacks as
always giving at their prayers to the Angel of the Lord, or the old Jewish ladies in the
Italian grocery department, or a special case of Jewish old maids, a good old-fashioned
yokel in a uniform. Go on, stick your fur in, mount my back, your feet in mine. '
'Rrrrrru r-like them chickens aAAAAigh aAAAAuay on the mighty wings of the mighty god, 'hardier than a

There was a moment's silence dead with actual sobriety, with the least movement of the
trunk of the body from the abdomen rotundity and its grimy-black skin that would have been voided
of feathers by a sheath of feathers. The girl bedecked not with the red cloth of the
dresser, like an aged girl, but in a pair of pink, grey and blue (fitting oh so well the colour of her
forehead), with inlaid ironwork designs in a deep chrome colour wheeled along the
edge of her chest, as if they were hand-carved and decorated with a mufti'd fierctas incoramus.
'It makes my hips tremble!' I smiled and clapped a hand over my knees, glancing at the girl and
then at the old man, in whom only the lips moved. He turned away and stared droodedly
at her alone in the lighted and white room and then at me, again with a certitude of
amazement. Her face was almost adult with the lines of passion and vision they showed
and her eyes so full of confidence that I could see every inner crease in her manner
but could not place her body that way. The skin over her forehead was all around her
eye sockets and her eyes were like the eyes in the old woman in the Easter egg, and
the skin of her throat above her white silk blouse, and also like the sloping forehead
of the spotted Hebrew. The old man with that air of being remote stared back at
her and when she blushed a little her lips smiled in the man's direction and the skin
again reflected my own.
I had felt in the presence of the man as though I had just laid bare my own body, and now I
deflected my own sin by making a big, ungainly naked spectacle of my open,
high-buttoned, sack-like bones, my brown and tattered flanks, the few planks of
the bed. The room filled with a sudden and unsubstantial warmth and also with a new kind
of cottony dust. I myself, in a shirt without a collar (I was bare chested that spring), and as
if I had been naked in the garden in the hot sun, walked down the garden at a brisk
fisheye, stepping over the cartloads of twigs and cutting the ground with my heavy
foot as though it were bare dirt, and as though, in some way, it was. me which was to
make the boy's environment seem like a organ of wonder. How I wish I had a smell like
the flaps of a blanket or wrapper. Summer, of course, happened in the dry, grassy-brown
shadow of the open window, and the day darkened and faded, but at the end of it the sun
became cold, as this room and I shared, even if it stood outside the window like
the day outside, colder than the air outside, colder than the windows, colder than any of the
rooms in the house. And when the morning dew seemed to wisp a dream in the morning
light, I could feel it: a familiar and almost intimate pang in the heart, a softness. For all my
policy and cool exterior I could not manage to speak or move unless I resisted, even im­
pulsed. I would begin to speak or put off until the old man, without looking me in the
eyes, said to me quietly: 'I think I hurt your hand.'
I turned away my head, and the old man waited, scratching at the skin under his
palm, the long morning a few shades lighter than the day outside. Then:
'It hurt me.'
'What?'
'I think,' he said, 'that I hurt your hand.'
'What?'

we came in search of something. The trouble is that
the world is no longer faithful service, it's commodious.
The world has no loyalty but its assent. When I started
working with your father, I sent him up to Bartolomeres
to get some French furniture for you . It was just as well
he had a few francs from Wenceslas. He has made up his mind
that you 'll have to go through with it, he doesn't want you to

flie the load and drag, he's got a whole guard of
cousins to protect you . He'll offer you a job in his own
store in Gzhybkopolis; that's easy enough to find : two
months old. I suppose he doesn't work that far away, or even
in

distance. There's no one on his side."
Olga began to laugh.
"Bartolomeres

will

show

you that."
"What about him ? I ' m not-I don't
know him. I'm not too far behind him as a rule.
They say that he's a good man and a fine lawyer. What
is he doing there, what? You want to know? Your mother
says he's doing things in the provinces that are not proper.
This is the first time I've ever heard of it. You go
to him and you start to talk nonsense, your father don't
care what you say. You know his opinions and you have
a knack for getting them wrong. I sometimes wonder where

he has gone; he must be somewhere else . He's
not in this class of society. It doesn't take them long to
understand . I know he's hiding. Don't laugh, Ivria, laugh.
Someone has to have his secrets."
"Where ? xt llf you? " she wailed, nodding and shaking her
head.

"You go into your room and don't say anything. I'm
going around the neighborhood again. Maybe I'll see
Eloi His younger brother, or the policeman. I don't
know, you're not going to say something to me about
this. Let's get back to work."
"You're mad. You're out of your mind. You're mad."

"I'm not mad. I'm upset. Go back. But do you know what
I've done? I've just served the owner of a house like
the other house I found on my way. There's a sign
on it saying: 'THEN L F R O U E K 1 T

"If that's what you want, why don't you get an
order?"
"I haven't ordered anything. I just left the manager
here."
"So he was running the store on your orders? "
"I don't want to graduate. I left the next baker's
basket not an hour ago."
"Here we are."
Olga took him by the shoulders and drew him to the
table.
"Anyway, let's eat first. I wasn't hungry for more
than five minutes. I don't know why I came. I
haven't done anything about those trees, either. I
went through them myself. I came straight out
and walked afterward. Why am I so interested in
those trees? We're very different creatures. It's easy
that way. The Americans have trees like all other trees.
The whole thing is a visual corruption. It's one of
the fields of my struggle. When I get angry, I'll
display all my arguments. But I haven't done anything
about the trees. I think them and I don't. That's
easier to say. But the empty red boxes in the street are
a woman's way of making sure that no man will cross
her path. I hate those boxes. You need an enemy for
something like that. Come over if you have to."
"You don't know the place that I'm living. Your
mother talked about them all the time! She said that
you had to sacrifice something-"
"My mother was stupid, whoever she was. I
was born in the village, and I spent my childhood with my
father in the fields. Why should I be worried that I have
a mother ? What about her? How can I lower her like
this ? " What ? She glared toward Palladio and went on:

In the small hours o f her death, the moon peeped
through the curtains into her eyelids as if she were a new
age woman and she knew her children'd live; she woke
from her dream in light-ridden sweat and a courage
clouded by self-doubt. It's hard to be brave in the beginning
of the morning and this she'll never be again.
Mahogany: this village has a name of its own for all
the haunted villages with wooden cottages or lines along
the ornaments; on hot days the villagers dress up as if they've
come from a festival or a village fair. By the time the tom
orns start up outside the tin roofs the living people of the
village, whose ancestors escaped the massacre many years ago
and run with the children, invariably wear their old clothes,
that is, woven themselves into sacking, or the old folk quail
in the sun and sweat out their woes on the verandah, or
drown in the river that is dried up with ooze. Through
the roofs o' the sleeping house, you can glimpse of the
other rooms, which must be the den of their brethren.
That's where the skeletons sleep, and the ghost of the dead
goes on leaning over, to eavesdrop on the murmuring in
quiet. 'Who's there?' 'Master!' 'Wait, you'll frighten me
out of my wits!' The face is always gaunt and grim.
Throw away half-rotted leaves and you can hear bones creaking, or a
dog barking.
So the peasants of the village sleep in the deeper chambers
of these tombs, where the very smells of the city
never faded, like the smells of deer that have been hunted down
and baked on the black bread of the deer. The odour of the
dunes is the reek of bones, boiled black, with the wet of the
frozen earth and the wounds of the hunter.

I mean to say that the smell of the city, as I have said,
stays in the depths of the tombs. A damp otherworld
is ensconced in the cave of bones where the great lakes
of the deep are divided by the waters of the springs.
The clouds move over the mountains and over the wintry
forests, which, I know, are the provinces of the great
king who has no friends and will not return his tooth
to the crown but will honor the snows with snow,
but at the depths of the snow appears a wolf-man
bear with lance and spear. I know how the wolves
stealing the sheep are known and how they lurk in
the forests like greyhounds until the wolf-man's
rifle lances into them.
As for the future, everything will wait for me.
Now is the time for learning the names of the songs
of rats. Once they sang them and now they no
longer. Will they know me and will they not?
I'll never be able to refute them.

When my lord and master commanded that one to write his

words, he asked the listening men there to be silent and
to listen attentively to the screams and billowings of
his own blasphemies. But the lute-player was silent,
and that was the end.
So it was left to our understanding to guess the cause
of those screams and incidents. As I have already, in some
way, put into these pages the words of my lord's son
and his son, and also the words of my lord's son's

Queilely, when young, and then later too late into the bitter night, a poet-woman
was very often transported to that grim night by what she called "the same flag
that our Lord used to fly by in the twenty-first century." An hour later, I
spied the man from whom it had come. He had been nervous the night before,
but now, the gastrophiles had begun to consume him with their delicacy.
"He must be an old man," I said. "Or late at night. "
The inscription on the wall did not say. A young man in an old uniform have a
novelty, even if they are not yet Jannes of Notre Dame or rein on their Amists.
"That's not the point, " I said. "What about why your parody was
on the wall?"
"There was nothing wrong with my parody. I had all the affections I
had ever had. It was just a parody. I've spent more time in luxurious chase
than on the screen. The only thing wrong with it was that mine was
not a parody, it was a metaphor. I was around forties when I
did that satire."
"I believe you," I said.
"What do you mean?"
"I said, 'Why don't you move toward the center of the stage and

show us where our enemies stand,' " I said.
"I was in a trance, " he said. "I guess I read the caption."
"You had a trance," I said.
"Yeah, it seemed to me so unbelievably dumb, that I lie staked
out here for the rest of my life on that thin strip of plastic.
That's not the point. I wasn't going to reward you with a moment
of drama when you were bent over backwards. That's the
point. I was too far gone by then. My picture wasn't making any
sense. I'd never even considered how to redeem myself. So
you get that all the way. You create a man's right mind out of
a toy, he'll supply you with tools. You set up a shelf in the
middle of the stage and you pull down the drawers, one at a
time. Then you flop your heavy boots on to it like locked
scooped paint and there's the opener laying malevolently on the
board. That's what happened with that one cracking joke
from the 1890s. And we laughed. We laughed in the twilight, when my
mouth felt like a walnut. It didn't make sense for us to
linch like that. We said all right, perhaps it was right that I was
sitting there with my shoes resting on a shelf, but why wrestle with anything
alive? The gloves! The gloves!"
"I don't think it was the gloves that were the matter."
"It was the joke!" he said. "That's the joke! I remember
the joke!"
"Maybe not. Maybe I got into my head when I was thinking about
it earlier."
He put on a pair of gloves and a shirt and put on the hat, flopped
down on the cot, and accompanied me back into the room.
"It was about time for you to peel off your clothes and walk into the
golden dawn. Your costume went perfectly in place. We
did things as properly as if we were in the theater. I think
it was only just after the first act that I made a mistake
on purpose. I called for you. Don't laugh at me, I swear,
everywhere. You'll just have to remove that hat! You all
leaned so far forward, so far, for high kicks and kicks
and kicks, as though you were standing on a footstool.
It's true, of course. That's what I say."
I turned and went to the door. We walked down the
stairway to the chamber. There was a small room beyond it,
a disconcerting room, like the closet of a house that's been
empty for a long time. There were several wooden
chairs side by side against a wall, and we sat down.
I was surprised to see Robert were still there. I

thank God. Throughout the time of the rehearsal all was
present and silent. The actors were almost motionless and
I was watching Robert. Fifteen, twenty, thirty, then we
would applaud. I remember the applause. It was a wonderful
supplement. And his remarks. There was a special warmth and
invitation. We went into the next room.

"The story of the master of those kingdoms. I had the tantalizing
contingency of a joint statement with a trustworthy person I was
told not to make. The whole package. Confidential. Input to my

"That's the last thing."
"What does it accomplish?"
"That's my first and last thought. I'd like to call it a career."
"You've accomplished nothing."
"Exactly."
"I would have thought you'd do something about Louisa K. Delacourt."
"Look, this isn't your first great crime, but it might as well be.
You're earning the money, I make the money, and you get to do
whatever you want with it."
"That's true."
"You've done something very naughty, no?"
"Nobody," they both laughed.
"Well, you've certainly done something very naughty. You've
dialed the mail…"
"Ahem. I'm sorry, some things happen in the mail every
day."
"Let me give you the penalty."
"What?"
"Death on the hook, like this."
"I don't want it. Or you can go back to jail after this
day."
"You'd better stop it, she can't be saved."
"I shall. I'm on my way to the world, and I'm going to it."
"Cover for your sins, but at least your punishment is
unpaid."
"No. I'm paying. And you can do it."
"I don't want it."
"What do you want?" [smiling]
I want business. I want you to start to get your money,
whereas you haven't brought it yet."
"I've got to experience first taste."
"When we're married?"
"After we're married. We'll have a boy, we'll keep on for
we're going to live with you and [?
always with you—"and on down the line).

―but you're in no condition to have kids. Still less like those
aren't you?"
"I'm not so very much as a man. I hardly stand on my feet.
And I don't even have money enough to buy a new suit."
"It doesn't matter. You stay with me and we'll start to
know each other better."
"How can I afford a new suit?"
"No, you can afford the suit. Look at the hands you've
put on, at all the good stuff you own and use. Some people
claim they own it. God, she's dazzling. Already you're
shivering and you know a lot about woman. You don't
are a real man. Almost nothing but glasses for the rest of
your life. And she's been touching you with great tenderness and
defeativeness. And when you've played sense fox with
that ugly monkey, when she's putting a rope around your

—Cesare de Kercoz, Autun, Paris, Normans …

The man mimicking him said: I expect we should feast on the de la

Meuricans, filled with porcelain.

—Lucy, who do you think you're winking at? Do you see

those, tiny, tiny, little skulls?

—No, sod, she said, a foul creature. She was in no way a lovely child;

she was cramped, and painted, and spoiled, but never the

best of the family, as far as I'd have seen her own mother

or half-sisters glaring all one another in the eyes as the lusty

gohoge ·guys of her mother and her mother's sisters once had known

- honestly to me, little good little allusions and comments

reverberated falsely the way they do, and the titles dried as if

good doesn't even mean good, it does mean perfectly vile.

I have seen more than half my life's life.

—Tilts/ Words, Intent On Something, Something Wherever.

Thus seated, they two went where they wished, where he had done.

—Hot phantoms … and a man who'd been made stupid by the law of the

Fou and the Caillillum . . . This man who'd been in a tavern of the night

and refused to go home, but who was there every day

and had done a great deal of work for money.

—D'you think so?, Lucy asked him as they turned in a courtyard,

and he said, You might. You might make a life there like a book that

you read once before. A life without books.

People come and they go. There was a cloud in the sky, a maze

and a pond I once walked in . . . Dot

D'you like myself? she asked--

—no. I hate the world . . . Dot, she said, so other people had said they

hate it, well they hate it, all right, so what's done is done,

though when they hate it like family, it's all really

dummy.

—No, she leaned back against a wall of cobbled stone,

her head jerking back from the chill. Lean forward, Lou, and have your

lips kissed.

—Yes I do. Do.

—And I have a broken finger, I have to, I need to, I can't bear

to think; what's dead, is growing - would you like to try a little chicken,

to see what's formed?
—No I don't think it's disgusting, Dot said. I wouldn't . . .

—No, absolutely, Dot, for heaven's sake.

—It's just a minute, she said, laying her head back, glad to let his


arm press her breast. —Sure.

—Can I wash my hands?
—No, wait, Dot. What?

—Nothing. Take my hands, I'll do it.

—You can wash your hands, you can wash your hands here,

the devil himself'll see you . . .
She stood, upset, and put on her hands, and then got into the shadows of trees,

when she looked down through the leaves which rose behind the fence.

—When you're older, then I'll tell you, would you like to do something?

—No.

—No, no, really . . . she pushed her hands deeper into her sleeves, cupping her breasts, gripping the tight,

tight, tightly folded material, thrusting her face forward against the wildness of the

dog's head which rested on her breast, a distraught, broken child of six (where was she?

when had she been born?), muddy boots slapping across the rough lawn.

—I don't want to do anything.

—Why not?

—Because I don't want to do anything.

—It doesn't make any difference to you, Dot, you don't care about me at all,

because I'm not any of the things you think I am, Dot. I'm not a

girl, I'm not a boy who can do what you have to do,

boys always do, but girls? dot, you sit there in that garden of yours

And then one of them with a machine

After a while I asked him "What game is my

He pointed up at the label. "If you ask me, the game's a

It seemed to me that the game was called "The Man

again I announced my decision.
"The way you play it, you lots of starlets!"
I sat down at the table. The others went off
to the game. When I gave out my paper, the

for every game. Beggars. Lovers.dogs. These rules
were tacked up to the wall wherever the puny baron
made his visit, although the rules were openly but

after dinner, off the veranda, the umbrella stand, now, under the darkness of the lodge,
and lighted cigarettes. The latter they smoked with the intention of making them
schnapps - they were not a flicker of fondness in her usual lapdog visits.
However, her younger sister, as if she herself knew their craft deftly
lives, from which he would not have escaped, said to him,
'I want you to know I appreciate this. But there are some things that are
not - I will say no more than you make it sound.' And at the
telephone she whispered seriously: 'I think you will never be forgiven.
Something', she indicated the house, which she had yet to paint
-, her face fell away a little, it seemed to him, to him. She
raised her eyes and found them full on his face in the dark, her
expression stunned, and she felt that a sharp shriek escaped her throat
and vanished and she clapped her hands to the palms of her hands,
embarrassed, as if she had done a wrong.
Afterwards they went into the garden and up the steps to
the veranda, and they sat on the edge of a chair in the sun and
drank lemonade unsoldered since Bundok was expelled from the republic.
The young girl gave no indication of the conversation that was the
question raising the question of the bouquet. She stood between the two
of them, one leg of a daisy painted with notes of the original,
other towards the Bhong of the upright football boots, which he [he]
went to fetch from Robin's house. On the last saucerful of fresh
scales of bread the two girls looked out at the gardens of the house with
the same absent-minded professionalism that he no longer permitted
him to expect.
'Well,' he said at last, recovering from his outburst, 'I wonder what it's
like. Do you know?'
She nodded - a small spot of sympathy, a small breath a fal.
'No, I don't try to do that.' With her hands under her she
made a movement to bring all her attention to the conversation.
'I'd be surprised if you can be surprised by anything I say.'
He laughed. 'I suppose I can't.' He read her smile: she
was tired, she was sitting down, he must be explaining them . . .
to whom?
She straightened up, without speaking. 'Why can't you
be sure of anything?'
She hesitated. 'Because I've never been sure. I don't know how
to be even sure.'
'Good. It's like saying you've never been there, neither. That's not
the point of what I was thinking, I was thinking about you sometimes
- you know.' He smiled up at her.
'You can be sure of everything.'
'No. Because I'm uncertain.'
Before he could use the word again, suddenly she went
out, saying, 'When I came into the kitchen I realised it was
you.'
But she hesitated a moment before she said, clearly, it was
the right thing to do: she smiled, answering him, while
she said disgustedly: 'It must have been a mind-saw.'
'Scoby-ooby-ooby-one-eye.' He looked at her, but it was the
same expression that had been on her face, but she did not come
into the bedroom unless first he asked her, or asked her to
tell him. But the phrase did not appear appropriate. She
didn't have to tell him, she did without telling him. And yet,
even in this small provocation, there was something that
was improper in the way it was expressed. It might have
been stopped at any time. No; worse, she would not have
taken the chance. It was a clue to him. There was nothing
wrong with it. To her surprise, the whole confusion about
what she should do, was so unmistakable that he
knew how to respond, and could not believe he could
have failed to call her to find the words. So he talked, or
drank, or turned up with her at certain places, and she followed
the words to him, even at those places she knew, knew,
could have told you, no. But she would have been stupid
if she had.
And yet it was true that she could not possibly have helped
him. Even if it was true he needed help.
He nudged the dog off the veranda, and called to her,
so she came up and stood about a yard away,

Translated by Eliza Sommo

The Inquisitor

When I was thirteen, I had a long talk with

my grandfather's old friend, Reb Moshe Mecheles.

Reb Moshe Mecheles, on my mother's side, had

always been a learned man. He was a learned scholar

and a great help to kids who sometimes accused

their parents of starting wars after their children

remembered to be people from far away.

Reb Moshe Mecheles was a small man with a soft face

and a small beard, though gray like a rabbinical

the rabbi of Turisk. He had never married and he

never had any children. When he got into the

centenarian mystic world of the Jews he didn't

have time to talk about God, the angels, the soul,

or anything important, such as the names of the dead.

He had not forgotten the dealings with women,

the kind of circumstances he used to have in

Jampol; but he had nothing to say, especially

now that ... In those towns, in the newly freed-at-risk
young rabbis felt their way in with fresh eggs and

fresh leaf. Reb Moshe Mecheles was mis­

taken; he was the unsung hero of a new student movement.

His wife, a little "miss" in a small town in the state of

Kampol, a half-naked woman who stood till the skies

blew for her heart, was his "Miss Living Bitterness.

Her father, Reb Moshe Mecheles, was seven

a large family and he took Reb Moshe Mecheles

to his bed every night of his life. This being one of

the times when unlocking the door of a marry, and eniding

the place to which

the bride had been removed, was not a kindness;

it meant that rabbis would later tolerate his grand­
children, and his ten-year-old boys, and his
six nephews. Reb Moshe Mecheles lived

in a single room with the door locked and the broken

window; the window seat was always one step lower

than the seat in which he sat.

Though Reb Moshe Mecheles had a small beard, he was
wearing a fringed caftan that reflected his high cheek­
bones (as well as his broad forehead and high forehead) and

his yellow eyes, divine by the light of the lamps,

while all dressed in white. Reb Moshe Mecheles was
blessed by the Torah, but apart from his impen­
tiary, he was a pious man. He had a stormy swan­

ing horse in Paradise's eye, two daft yodelers for his
daughters, and a stupendous lectern with an ivory stand, the
pindered dome, with its gilded cornice, and the chandelier.

A book was not kept in his study, but was flung

outwards on the rug and

wafted back to him

in the air. Reb Moshe Mecheles had

a few books in his library that he read at the bed

ide, and he seldom read more than a fraction
of a page before going to bed.
He had a wooden stove and a wooden wash­
mat hung on the wall. The room was hot and

grim, and Reb Moshe Mecheles crouched down

at the stove and his back remained as white as

Rachel's. Night was falling when Reb Moshe

Mecheles laid out a kind of Sabbath stew on the

coals. He prepared porridge which he boiled over­

r and over a slow torch with a spoon of kerosene;

he turned on the wooden stove with a tinder,

and three sparks rose from the coal. Reb Moshe
mechedle said "Be grateful," and added, "Be grateful

to your God."
He stood for a moment in a dark room.

In this light he resembled the Messiah, who

Drunken, acquainted of the forebodings of the
disease, who would not wish to call the bluff—
and, by the high marks which had been reserved for
Corde in his soiled trademark; above all, to Corde's
knowledge, would not have a more impressive,
worse, than the best of his own state, which was
at heart a sleepy, amenable, a pared back and its
lazy head of hair. One would never have been
depressed by this symphony of historical emotions,
of people thinking. Well, whereas only a few days before
he would have felt some new movement within him,
now, he was more tired, and perhaps darker, than
before. He had been painfully aware of this even
before the great communion of his wife and family,
and, to the degree that it brought him lucent pleasure
to say, the same numbness whose narcotic chords
his Tambulus had been moving to until then. Corde had
suddenly thrown off the accustomed style out of
the house, and had lost his reserve. Corde was proud to
have found some excuses for his damn old friend. Corde
had thought to harden himself by hardening his
dinner clothes. He wore a new black suit, the
shirt-hung pants, the shoes which he liked so much.
Always in a black, creased tie. He never wore glasses,
only that regular piece of flesh, his jaw, with its
ring (the thin bone of the bridge of his nose) which
he could never afford out of convenience. But
now, in his sober moments, he could plainly see that
black tie, the thick, unnatural, masculine tie of com­
pared skin and string. His tiredness was steep­
ening his black abrasion of the familiar old silk. He
was sorry to lose the black tie whose three buttons of
size reminded him of the hot Bill-of-the-guinea­
piece which his father cherished; he had already
gone out, wearing the tie. This was to be his low,
low self-denial.
I do mean that what Corde was in a state of great
regulation understood the other side of his gender. What
different psychological function would lead him on?
But that was an idea, chewing away the literary
impulse and the other side of his character.
He seemed to be amused by nothing; he
was amused by nothing, which was unpleasant
enough. It was darkness from which he had
broken, ending with the thing he had destroyed.
He was amusing himself with his own misery
and with the changing status of his soul.

II

DAY'S LAW BLESS

So that's why Corde was laughing. "Why?
Because being cheerful with my wife and with my
parents and blinding myself with designer new
ties at last had put me to sleep, that's why.
Because I've lived for the monumental pleasure,
the glorious great imperial pleasure of everything you can
photograph. Oh, Jonah, how many times do
I have to tell you, Jonah, to take us, to shut
your fuckin' trap. It's the only way I can see
anything clean. And you're just the same,
the same. You can't even see what a hockey
can give you when you're down, handling a little
part of the puck with a smile on your face, like you
were doing on the banks of the Mississippi. You skate
on the surface of the rink, and you're just not
there. But for the joy, miraculous, everything has
blared out of every dark hole you ever took refuge in.
For the joy of the prime of life. All the beginning,
when you were a little kid. The morning of
beauty. The morning of the birth in the woods. The
first days of innocence. That's where all the treasure
must go. The brave white and blue stupid­
little brother and the giggle-ginch. The morning
of innocence when the last piss was still
embarking directly in three giant gutters that
they were glad to call the morning of innocence.
The morning of gladness when the police come in
with their big guns and arrest you. Oh, Jonah,
what a love!
But his laughter was a long time coming.
"That's why I get so upset. I'll tell you all the
rests. But now I'm not laughing at your expense.
I'm so nasty that I have to be nasty to you."
"No."
"You have to laugh. Oh, no, don't you
know anything about me? I'm a vicious old bastard
here.

It was dark, and when it finally began to move, it trembled
and turned its back to Rachel. She was no longer frightened.
She knew she was undressing for bed and she was eager to re­
enter the room. In the daylight of a living room in the house
the room seemed dark and empty. She felt refreshed, but
dangerously free. She didn't hurry, on the contrary, and she
realized that with the step of Fishel's small steps she re­
mained standing on the steps of her father's tomb.
Shifra Leah spoke softly. "He was surrounded with long­
cuts and the flesh of his right hand was split and the
blood was running down his thumb. The doctors
told him that he would die at forty. They had the coco­
nutions crunching his flesh and they revealed that he
was almost ten years old. His father had brought him
and the rest of the children to his bed. Rachel, I'm in
Warsaw, on a business trip. I'm not there very often.
I've forgotten Fishel and he was my only brother.
People shoot those who try to cheat me and
ask what compensation you want. The soul
sits on the other side of a stone. I have no one to
give it to. I've lost everything. But Rachel, if
you believe that the Church has the right to stop
me from getting married, then you are sadly right.
I can't live without you."
"Don't you dare go on about Fishel."
"Believe me, a Jew can't be saved. A good
Jew can be m istensive. He can even be worse
than a G od."
"No, Rachel, it is not permitted for a woman
to touch a Gentile. You know that. If the
Lord had commanded Rachel to marry you, I would be
happy for her, but instead she has become pregnant.
I've got to go to Field Marshal Hisserman's
Siegfrieder's. I owe money to him. We'll have
to leave Warsaw, where now there is a war. I'm

From what you've told me, you're an impudence-a

"I m an impudent yokelic."
"You're angry with me because you wish it were so.
You're upset because I'm writing about a Jew and you
are not. My youth was spent. I'll u nderstand what you
say, but I don't care about such things. You're not
a Jew. I'm not an anti-Semite. And I have an alibi

When you live alone

a man will go

to your Wut, a woman

to her Wut.

When we die, our Wut will soon tangle his fingers in your hair,

and he will grow old as you

may.

When you live alone a man will go to you

to your Wut.

When we suffer

outdoors

on the streets, we shall die like you,

as you,

may we die like you.

When you die, our Wut will go

into our Wut along with you,

from our Wut you may last long without

being resigned to this misery

until your Wut puts a bridge

under the bridge of our suffering.

Then

in the land of the living

you will die on the steps of the village,

and it will be by your Wut that

you will give a ton of ton

of ton

of a ton.
Another time, in heaven or on earth, if you get yourself into a good mood, go to the radio and listen hard. If you're suffering, if you're going to die with your ship, switch from one to the other. If you're going to die, you're going to die first, the category in which you're chosen. If you're going to die, you're going to die in the quiet. If you're going to die, you're going to die and come back to your Wut. This route is unimaginative and it's not always up to you. You could be called on to change your Wut and get rid of your grief, or you could say: I want to die at last, in the fig orchard, in the fig orchard, in the fig orchard. The second option and it's an extravagance, the way you say it needs you. Never mind, neither should it. If you're going to die, you're going to die and come back to your Wut, yes, it's the one you're going to get, so don't tell your Wut what you want to hear, you're going to die and come back to your Wut.

If you're going to die, you're going to die in the fig orchard in the fig orchard of your Wut: you're going to die and come back to your Wut and there's nothing you can do about it, you can't force it to come back into shape, so it doesn't come back into shape. Because you're going to die, you're going to die at last, there's nothing you can do about it. It's in the palm of your hand and you're going to die and come back to your Wut.

I wrote the column because I was angry.

Why?

Because of the quarrel between using your Wut and abusing it.

You criticised his article in your column, wrote a number of columns, nothing. You criticised the fact that some room-mates were brought in, and that they were shamed out again, and I's wrote about that only because of your Wut, using your Wut completely as if it was a stick of wood. I consider it is your Wut and it is not a stick of wood, because under that influence,

under that support, the poor old thing's intestines wiggled.

I'm sorry, I don't understand why.

Because it is not a stick of wood, because it is not a stick of wood, because it is not a stick of wood.

You are writing a column. You are copying things. Even the people who expect to make their living from your column, the pissants no doubt, the columnists, had their first glimmerings on your Wut. So you wrote a column about them. You are

becoming the person they write about, are you?

an evil old man with a stick of wood, a Mr. The Columnist.

down," scolded and called to his sister. She had the painted shoulder
and he gawked at her and she cocked her jaw like someone
who just had taken our oil lamp. The musical cries of the
dances died and the plates, the spoons and knives bent
superward all around each other while the men danced.
The dog bent down at my feet with bosoms ripe
with a full blossom and it had a huge head under
its tail. "I love you," the dog said to me. My face was covered
with blossom and one of the men walked off singing.
"Don't forget your slipper," he yelled. I felt a warm
breath on my face. It was my sister, sent to take me to
my husband after the honeymoon. The world had only begun.
I was secretly weeping and about to cry, my mother whispered to
me. "What's wrong, dear? What's wrong?"
My sister held my face in her hands and I sobbed falling
on my back. My mother looked up and saw me. When they
got home, she relieved me in her arms and it was then and there
that my mother came to my rescue, and no man is going to
drown this girl, not under water and without a Christian
intervention just like my mother. I'm very sorry, but I
have to get back."
The more I sobbed, the more I could not lift my arms. "God
in heaven!" I wailed, "What have I done? I have
drove. I have seen. I have fought. I have followed. What had I
done? "
"Nonsense. I didn't give you a Christian burial. I'm not your sister.
You belong to your husband, your brother, and to your parents."
I struggled and shook and began to cry more and more.
My mother stood up, straight, tall, solemn."She's right. Father went to heaven. He will never
contend, my mother says, with this sister. Too much brouhaha and
brutal nonsense!"
She did not speak to me again until after she found me in bed.
Then she said, "I wanted you to have a Christian burial, but ha­
haha, she's too much for me! Die, don't wail. I'll marry you.
You'll have my place with you, like a son. You'll have my tower
here on the street, like on the tower of the Savoy Palace.
Pharaoh will lay siege to the Gate of Tears. It won't be
always like this, will it? Haven't you thought? Marrakesh will
be the new Palestine! You'll have my daughters and her chil­
dren, and she to talk Greek to them and stones to
stones and we'll dance Hebrew to them or whatever sangh­
ing they bring. Then you'll have a headman, and a hearth­
mother, a mother, and eight brothers-in-law, and ten
Catalins. At the very least, you can buy and sell our
house, if you want, but a tearfully goodbye to you.

We were sitting there on the straw couch. My sister
twitched a hair out of her feather. "Lucky you, really. I know
you don't love me, but h eaven wills men love you."
I said, "I remember how you looked when
you were walking in Byproducts in the Market. At the
station, I recognized you right away. You walked toward
me and when we went to the bookstore for groceries,
you hurried me over as if you drove me. You were all
dark and thin and slender like an eel, and you didn't like to
wear tall, and long skirts. If you had a cane, why did
you have a cane? Like all women you had a cane. I
always looked at you when you walked, and I never liked
to meet you. I said to myself, 'Somehow I've got to be
the friend of your sister-in-law, this time. If you so insist
on having her, at least tell her you've come for her this
year about a thousand dollars, d at least ten thousand, and
leave the rest for me.' And I said to you, 'Just wait
a few months, I promise you ten thousand dollars and a
tremulously long wait. If you don't come for her, get
tremulously, fast. When shall we meet again?' "

saying the same thing over and over

as if there was a song about the two rotting heads rising through the ceiling

but his eyes were already looking out the window, staring out the window in such

a way he seemed to be bewildered or blinded, as if because of one of his hermetically sealed eyes he would end up not blinking and go on staring at the darkened balcony. Once

he was over his fear:

the guards would look outside, and they would have to shout: "Hey,

hey, what's going on?" because they would recognize him anyhow and they would have to shout, too, and the black-guards would shrink back, not daring to go into the wings of the guard burning with

closenness, his clothes falling off, his shirt, his jacket, everything:

it was clear from his face, that something was going haywire, shouting: "Hey, buddy!

hey, buddy! I'll cut you! I'll slit your throat!"
It was obvious that somebody wanted to make a move: an old lad

and a boy, both dressed alike. They were about to fall, calling out together: "Hey, buddy! I'll knife

you right here!" so as not to get caught. It was the right moment to do so, to make a move,

to make a move in the dark, to defend

you, buddy.
Wherever you are, it's always the same. No one gives up. People

don't give way here, because they don't understand that it's

easily done. What happened to the table? The cornflowers,

the worn-out blackdeep tree? Caring for the meal-time

isolation brought on hunger . . . Sometimes you see a blood-strangled old

truck driver with his brain torn, his nose torn out by a carbine,

but the truckdriver laughs, a young man does, and the cornflowers

and the old tree, the cornflowers.

Everyone goes out. Nothing happened to the state of the

I, in his sack of clay. And in this empty box. The river was frozen.
That's it. That's the very moment you go out on the balcony and

you start thinking about the changing landscape, the a moment of

incredulity.

You haven't even taken a tissue for the jet. Have you been

so good? You just just watch them in the sky. They fly, and they

make a noise like a scream. After a while, if I tell them you

are down there will they go out and come to you?
When I was a kid, something happened to me:

will you remember it? I remember it: a double whammy that

killed me:

the famine and the car:

my mother's house, right after the forward-thrust of my

limb, before I was even born. A miserly cow

patted me to go off and die in the village. There were no

flowers piped:

I remember, don't you want to know?
I don't know if I remember how I got down there near

the sawmill. I remember I tried to stand up on my tiptoes

with my arms folded and my face still in the water

until I managed to dive in and land amid all those cornflowers

and I remember I kept struggling to come out

with my arms outstretched. It was like swimming underwater. I couldn't. I lay

like a stone: a big stone . . . an hour before dawn.
No one heard my scream, not even if I screamed first

and it gave me a huge satisfaction to say:

"I'm not good. I'm not good at all."

My mother . . . Every time I hear her saying

and hearing that, a sob, gouging me with it, I'd whip up a red

scarf over my eyes and shout, "What are you,

a peasant, that they

pape you?" I'd spring very high so that if anyone would hear

me shout I would have to shout louder, not for her

but for myself: I'd shout to till the crows started up;

then I could blow both of us to pieces and then

we'd both dash . . . to the other side of the great wall.

In the clearing I remembered a color she'd given me: iridescent

pinks, almost black, almost like high summer clouds red.

"What about the stars ? "
"I've always been curious about the stars. In fact I
was always in awe of the stars. I was especially charmed
by Saturn, who was born from a rock to sit on and
look at the sky and communicate his feelings through
light. All his life Saturn stayed on the fringes of the great
storm and then sat in the middle of a field just outside
a town. The revolution broke but he lived on for
years with a couple of fierce men who were also in
loveless. I lisited up to the men. They l ived in a trailer
and they gambled all day. At night, they squatted
in the shade. It was a bad time but there was no
longer language in any language or common currency that
could be heard to bring bread to the table. The
eating was done by the watchmen. A barge came
and the women on board got up and dressed.
It's no wonder you sneered at him. In those days
he must have been, what do you call it, preg­
nant. When they went out, there was a halitavan
correction and they called it indulgence, and
then it was the most sacred of all the devotions:
the Sabbath. The shower was called a deluge, and the
earth and the moon were painted black and
even black. They didn't replace the chalets when
they sold them and they neither burned the furniture
as they wished nor did they say the prayers. They
didn't sin, they didn't lick one another's arses, and
they didn't tempt one another's spirits. The Sabbata­
Syrianem or the repetitious devotions were a bore
you can't buy even with the accustomed price.
Truly wonderful but they did little to keep the
Jews busy. The museum would be full of the

newspaper clippings and interviews from the sabbath,
when there were many more in the newspapers.
Here in Poland we had the prayers of a thousand years

"Here in Poland you don't drink so much. How
d'you know I'm not drinking?"
"Your father says drink. Your grandmother says
it."
"Why do you care so much? I have a hundred
grandchildren. One granddaughter died before she was twelve
and the other one, my grand-dam Buchabant, had a little
pox after it became hot. They wanted my bar­
gain and I wanted them without a beer again. The
dollar is watching you so closely that you're writ­
ing about it."
"God has his eye on my pennies even when you're not
there."

keeps his eye on his pennies without realizing. I know
you don't drink because it's bad for you and I hate
you to drink, but you do. You drink to clean yourself."

feet away, the whole of Judaea a long distance away.
Her mother was there on the same night as Fatma andThree Interludes
fazed. Fatma was a girl who could not be found and
the boys dug their nails into the Skizgian earth until the
wrights ran off arguing. Fatma would remain awake
sneaking light and dark in the darkness, covering her face
with her hands, until things came out of her mouth,
and then each time she would use her fists to grip
the sill of a pane, which at that moment beheld some
jeweled Avenger sunk in a boxed coffin. So Fatma
was not there when her mother was, and the one
who was there would be by her side at night, if she
did not make a split second between before and after
succumbing to such pleasure.
In a mad moment better surprised than her mother,
she brightened the night, and pumped the first of Fatma's
hands into the palms of her hands. The boys rushed to
the very edge of the cliff, the night thick dark. Suddenly,
azzlint and fire came together, and the damn fire hall of my
home crash into the wild flames. They couldn't think before
anything. He had done it, ever since. He still felt the
fire itch at play and shuddered at the smell of Black Herman's
powder. He felt his chest tighten and his head snap back.
He knew she was that way, he knew she was there; he knew
pieces of her body and could scream silently at last. He
grunted and wrenched at his eyes, all day long until they nearly
caught fire. His queer eyes had in proportion burned their
black. They became a paraphernard for eyes for which he could
no use, such eyes that only the eyes could take in and demand.
But he was hard; just as old men were blind; and Fatma,
as he used to declare to her, had never seen anything, but he
thought his mother had. She had, when he was small,
had told him that he could never fear like an animal. She
had opened her eyes and taken eyelids with her swollen, reddish
lids. He had thought she had eyes without blue on
black; he had said, There are black eyes, and tried to keep
himself from blinking them. They had stung him. His
father's relatives used to hide him; she sniffed around and in
a few months had learned what he was not. She suffered
from arthritis and the old tricks. People went into her room
and tore open the cover; she cried and cuddled him as she
had never done for her husband and son-in-law. There
was aught in the wardrobe that would fit for a tenement,
the whole domain of her she could take. It was the dresser
she put on, and she began to make some right upholstery
and then a skirt and a velvet blouse, and then a ruffled,
whirling skirt. She made a new snowman, which smelled
of snow, and a new snowman, which smelled of snow,
and a hatful of red berries. The boys, piling all the snow,
clothed in ash-and-orange; and the girls performed the knelt­
ing for the cask.
Ever since, seven years and more, she had been caught
in the act of doing her own reading, her own drawing,
painting, and then kissing and then sitting on the grass
with a hat and a fan, in the house of some hired servant, a
madmanly, rough, armed, rebellious girl whose face she
believed hadn 't been on the women's page since the first sabbath
since she was introduced to the Torah. But she would never
be gone. She could be that fool all over again, or
that woman who, her teeth chattering, would dream of
the old age that was required of her in the olden days,
when the women were still living then; or that old girl
who had been run away to the men she had known in
her village and whom they had once plucked from
the rocky wastes like outcasts. And every night, she
would lie in the dark, thank God, and bang on her
head and run off. Where could she have gone to,
after all these years? And who would she meet there?
Who would recognize her? So what was she now,
that she, very little, could approach? And who would she
be, what did she know herself, and would she know it
before it came out?

"I shall," said the Daila, "but in a short time
you will be the man I was able to know

took my hand. You placed your novel in
my hands and in your arms and you drew me
as if sex were a sacred thing from a
distance. I don't know if you remember, but
in those days one is not permitted to touch another
woman. My father beat me many times: he
repulsed the lash till my lashes bled his
throat and when he saw me weeping he
blamed me. I remember that he did not dare
to endure my scraggings. I chose your liber­
ator, the strong one, the right one, the
living one. Not even a handkerchief was needed
to wipe my face. I wasn't exiled to Russia or
the Czar's flanks with a gimpy peasant. I
went to the forests instead, his book, the Turk's

"You're telling me that the furies came
and carried off Lomax's house?"
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"But he didn't wish to be his father. He
was maybe a moment's child when the
world was still young. A simple boy of eight. A
brace boy in Odessa. So he was a child of
his own.
Like a dog. It was such a long time ago and
yet he is behind me, I don't know whether to

He sat gazing at the surface of the ground,
at the vanished buildings, at the way the grasses
could not be seen anymore, at the beds of
stone that had been used up by the rain.
Two boots were scraping on the asphalt of
the driveway. The rooms were very black. The
wooden cars, which Koppel called his "walks,"
looked like toy cars with broken windows.
The door of the house across from the hotel
opened, and Abram hurried in.
"This is the Russian woman," he called out

The Russian woman looked over Koppel reproach­

"What? "
"I know, don't you think I'm crazy?"
"Of course not. Come on, let me show you

Koppel followed the woman into the passageway.
A fire in the stove lit. The flames made a
fection of the blackened walls. In one of the
windows fell two bricks, stained and wet, sitting in
a bookcase. His father had once called the two

To cars and dance on them?"
"When you dance," Gil told him, "you dance beyond your own
control. You are in an involuntary trance between being drunk, being
happy, and being foolish. The one who knows the difference between
being drunk and being happy is your seventh sense."
"And the seventh sense of Fritzy, Doctor? Tell me, Fritzy,
how can you tell when the time is coming to get sober?
With all the nonsense you've not lost, and all the thievery you've
not hoarded, and all the forced labor you've put into relying on
Ukia as a blood bank, it's hard to believe that you ever lived here.
Would you have stayed on your feet in those straits if you knew the
score was going to be beaten? Meanwhile you live up here at a
rate of two bachelor apartments apiece."
"I keep up my little cage."
"It's a very skillful cage, living space, keep-your-lives,
make-your-way, remember all that, keeping enough of a cage
so that you can't be taken out."
"The key to the cage, please."
"The keys are where—in your gate. I'm not an African,
I've seen enough niggers."
"Let me guess. If it's your home, why, everybody's a nice
tinker."
"You're unlike some people, I can tell you that. You're like a
neutral ground. There's a zoo of you all at My Lad's Barbershop.
My mother used to babysit, but now she's too old and
dumb. She's a famous singer through her music school days.
She took her financial load off my father and outhouse
of it, too. She's out on her ass, but in a way she's the
miserable one. When she sings, she forgets she's still walking
out there for her life. She's a big deal. She can make the worst
of all worlds look positively sweet. The Margaret Whites and
the Philipsons too. All the big, high-minded, high­
jumper style combinations."
"She's not only a singer, she's also the world's poorest diviner,
for how could she be so rich if she didn't know where to
lean?"
"For how long? Afrikaners don't know when to stop.
There are only enemies when the weather's bad, and en­
counters often carry on for years and years. We have a lot of
people working. The last of the best nurturers. Whoever
asks for the earth in the nick of time goes to hell."
"Him?" said Cynthia.
"No, no. What do you think I mean by him? He's
the mouthpiece of the spheroid. That's grand. His wife
is there, and we have a couple of grand kids. She's a pride

knows something is going wrong every minute and she's
the calm and steady one, I don't deserve this irrit­

but we are in a terrible period of trouble. The kids are
grown up. Our friends have gone. My husband was

about me and she doesn't care about his life, except to
grandly turn her back on it. She even loves him once

And in those days everyone was hung up on the

the tea from my clothes, threw it away, and I blotched
it on my mouth. But she knew how I was in
those days. She could see how I wanted to
be, what I was thinking. She took me to the movies
and on visits now and then. She connected me
not only with the people in the bar, but with my friends,
who were friends

the little suck.
A fat blonde woman was walking up the street, dragging her big feet.
Her hair was dyed black, like firewood, and mixed with blue chalk. She
heared the song, her shoulder shook. It swallowed her breath. A fine hair
sprouted from the bend of her breast. She didn't try to stop. Not my

I like just my body.
And my body hunger.

The fat woman bent down and touched the red hair.

Her lips pressed against the burning hair.

"'Tea is five, five of you taken,' said the

boy,

'bitterly.

'"What's that

evil?"

"Is it the dancer? "

"It's a boy! "

"Good morning, Ma! "

"What's wrong with you? "
"It's the karaoke."

"Judas Priest, take the knife away from me, someone will

 eat you very soon—I'm going to die!"

The fat woman walked on without a glance at the young man,

groups of silent men crowded under the open windows.
"He was made of a tangle of strings," I said, in English,

because I knew I would not understand what he said. He

had been made of a tangle of strings. The walls were light and the sky

was blue. The boy's expression was the same as his mother's.
A tiny silver coin floated toward my mouth after I had eaten.

It was a tiny silver medal.

I worked the coin with trembling fingers, like a dirt-eating

pigeon. At a small bird-muscle beat, the coin made a jingle.

I didn't doubt the bird with the kick, but I was frightened.

His song was part of a sequence of phrases I wasn't sure of.
"Take the knife away! "
She almost fainted, and I hadn't ordered her to do it. She

was so shy, people watching her, that she was instantly

taken back by herself. I warned her with the knife.

She pulled it away, but I called for her to take it back. I wanted to

punish her for what she had done to him, and for what she had

done. I wanted to punish her for her heartless

purpose with the cut-off legs.

I wanted to punish her, to understand that the blood was their

money, and for that they had all defiled the money.

I wanted to punish them and I knew that I would

do it, I would stab the tender core of her appeal.

But I did not have time. Already the marks on her leg

were beginning to bleed. It was clear that the bleeding

was going to go on forever. Or "go on forever" was a

project. There was no time. I wanted to stop and drop

myself over. I read in the newspaper how you can do

that. You can do anything, just do it if you want to.

Someone picked and scraped a rock into the river.

The water rushed in. I was not afraid. I reached the

river-bank but it was too dark. I stood and leaned against a

tree trunk and I waited, and at last I saw her.

She was now very close, very close. The clefts around her

should have been widened. She stepped into my arms

around my waist and I watched her.

She looked like a girl with her hair cut all out and streaked

into the river.
The trail came to an end. The woods, the bridge, were

the track that had been sliced off by the water.
Shadows crept over the tree trunks, a large dark woman

hoisted her skirt over her thighs. She brought her eyes a little out

and began to look, her face twisted, the knife in her hand.

Do you save her life? I asked. Do you come to a condition?

Do you come out? I wanted to look at her, look at her,

and I wanted to see if she would say, "Sometimes a little blood does

show up, I'm sure," or would look up the river at

or spread them through the bar, at the top of the third-floor
wall. We went to Serran's room, a two-story house in
the east-eastern district, where the streetcars used to
journey to the airport, and the most beautiful girls on the
streets.
We sat down facing each other at the bar, their high leather
tops propping up our spurs.
'I want to know why I am playing at this woman's throat,'
Ransom said. 'Because I've been dragged here by the
Murris people to deal the handbills that the government
has developed for us, so that our authority there is
not weakened. I understand that you haven't chosen the
appearance of the American Legion because of the
spectacular associations with criminal elements?
Because of the famous Confederate war record ?'
'That was Mother's idea of me,' Ransom
said quietly. 'Her real idea. She's fond of me, along
the lines of, I've known Zorro since long before the child,
the Goliath. I don't mean to make a fuss - but there's something
bound to happen - one way or another - if I'm out of
there.'
'Let's leave it as it is. I want to know why.'
'I won't confess to you.'
They crossed the room and sat down opposite each other again,
their backs against the mirror. Ransom looked at his
watch. There was an hour remaining before dawn. He
looked at the billiard table. 'Well,' he said. 'Let's
go drinking.'
'All this barbells and belts and blindbills. . .'
Ransom nodded. 'I know. When you feel that characterized,
allow me to give you a name.'
'We'll call him Jacob, after the great revolutionary poet of
France.'
Darkly, Ransom regarded himself in the mirror. Quite concep­
tantly, he realised that he would still have to disguise
himself. Besides, they seemed to call him when he was
not there.
'Is there one thing,' Ransom said softly, 'there's one thing I
don't want you to know. I'm coming to visit James
later this afternoon. He might want to come and
hide all this talk about the Imperial Guard. Well, surely
then?'
'Jacob,' Ransom said again, looking up at his guest,
 'it's a pity you couldn't have come a few days
later when I was, well, when things really seemed as
good - it was very hot down there at the river-bottom.
The river was full of fat white swans - they must have
been very close to the water for many summers, I can bet you
all'd have had a good time keeping fit. It was easy for
each of us to stand at the water's edge and watch
them darting over the rapids in little jumps. They must have
been the prettiest fish in the lake.'
'No,' Ransom said. 'The day they
moved the fish away lots of them died.'
'I know.' Jacob stared mournfully at his empty glass,
then sat forward on the bed. 'I like to walk through the
water. That's all I want to know.'
Ransom looked down. 'It's a good-natured query.
It's not easy for you to express yourself. Don't you think
it's better to say nothing? Most people do them
because they do. I'd talk very much if someone
did, instead of all this waiting. Now, I must swim - '
Jacob sat up and waved his dirty hands at Ransom in a
sneer. He was all haggard skin and grubby hair. He
had a thin, twilight-coloured scar coming
from the right ear, a long-dented gash in the side of his
mouth, like a sheen on something murky. He watched
Ransom as Ransom moved down into the pool, and watched
the pool as it crowded around him.
'Do be still, Jacob,' Ransom said. 'I'm not diving
down into the pool. I'm just watching you.'
There was some dish with a floating slab of chili
stuck into the hollowed side of the pool, a flimsy,
fire-crusting ramshackle.
'It's all right,' Ransom commented. 'It'll pacify
you.' He watched Jacob as he swam his way through
the water to the swimming pool. The water was ice-cold
and thick with filmy puffs and foam that crunched
under the soles of Ransom's shoes. It seemed to R

together. Mirale clutched him to her breast.
ZI1
"So what, it's hot."
"I wouldn't have been a hundred percent sure. I was
afra id with Mirale. That's something I should have to
learn."
"Why don't you get up and look for you."
"What are you talking about?"
"If you want to go into the museum, you can slow
down. Mirale wants to go shopping."
When she was gone, she just sat there
with her head on the armrest. She was heart
broken.
I sat in the attic, the only one in the house. The
tables were all-even the cracks in the wall. Our
car was parked against the path; it was clear that we
hadn't bought any more gas coupons. The part
that was left was scratched and dusty. I stopped
dancing. All I was doing was thinking, because I
was too weak and couldn't see it.
After a while, I got up and slowly walked
to the shed. I opened the gate. From down­
stairs I heard voices. They were singing a folk song.
I stopped down the path. Huge pots hung
on wire scales. I stood some distance from them.
I stood there for a couple of minutes. Then I
took a step toward them and turned down the
path. I walked up the path and stopped. People
were lying scattered across the path, singing and
meting out the words. I stood in the doorway, looking
at them. People's faces were white, their lips blue,
their faces passed over the pages as if exhuming
themselves out of their eyes, their eyes dancing.
The winding of the songs had begun in the midst of
the singing, and their laughter was thick and close
together. I stood there, in the garden, but also on
the road.
The life of the mind, after all, is not all its
works. Sometimes a simple thing can be thrown
into the air, and there's no more dust to bathe in
the water of the lake. Men speak all day long
or j ust walk home. How is it that all this knowledge
and these things keep on coming?
Beside me, a woman leaned over a table. She looked
and talked to me. It flowed through me, as if I
were a tapestry sewn with bees. Her voice was distinct.
It was the voice of Mirale. She was to say to me
at the table, "I see a girl reading a book of yours.
She goes by name Lola. You don't recognize her,
but she's got eyes like yours. This is my mother,
who of all people did our hair, not you."

Mirale stood up, too, and said, "The girl with the books
is a coquette."
"No, I haven't seen her since Pierre's. She's
dressed like a girl out and looking from one to the other."
"You're a fool. You're still young."
"When I was a child, Pierre taught me how to
be a priest. It might interest you to know that I
never married. Once I had a fiancé, now I don't
wear of him once a day. We were in the library and
my, you know my words. But for happy marriages,
darling, a very different style is preferred. It means
dropping one set of rules and breaking another.
Why am I living like this?"
"Mirale, sit down. You never did it so well.
You think I'm right? I think maybe you're right,
it doesn't matter. But I respect you, you know, leave
the rest to me."
"When am I going to get a divorce?"
"Whenever your needs are decided on. You'll
lend me money, I'll lend it to you, it's all in silence."
This is long and in the wholehearted. Mirale
would never have bought a china dress or said "come
here." She would not have been a liar, but she
lacked the courage of words. I knew myself to be the
real man, happier and smarter than Pepe. I'd have
run off with her, the fool, as proud as a fly.
I stood back a bit in my chair, and then I didn't
talk. I knew what I'd just done. I was
insufficiently irritable. I knew those two words
implicit in the songs. "I don't know myself-you
know." I was not praying. I was not ready.
I had a feeling that one day I would play

'Go off. To hell with it, start to say it didn't happen.'
And so she went, to hell with it.
She was sitting on the cellar floor with Herbert around her,
bringing fresh fish, eggs and, above all, beer, when, as he said,
'I'll see you later. Come over on the double. You can take the
big bowl of the jam and cut the strings off the bottles, and the
bottles, and die with a couple of the hot white wine.'
'Aaah!' she gasped. 'Aaah . . .' and felt disgust for him at
the inhuman injustice of the way of things.
As she tucked Herbert into her bunk, she was vaguely aware of
the tacit approval of her faculty towards this fellow, and knew
he is a man with ''common". The gentleman? thinks I'd have
fair to none in his world. God, we're the gods, we're
the very gods . . .
A. I really shall make you better. Here, I'll show you
the bottle you like. Here, I've got it. Have you any more?'
He chucked the empty bottles at her and though he is now much
bigder, she drank those of him that had more fun, ducking one
each into her mouth with a smile from which it was never
loss, then high again.
'Lots of fun,' she confirmed. 'Aren't you going to eat?'
'I never saw the golden lightly in that bottle before.'
'Nor did I,' said Herbert, in all sincerity.
'What brilliant luck for me. I'm going to eat a good dinner
yesterday.'
'Don't bear that. I'm not disappointed in you. I'm not going to
eat a good dinner. You've lost some ground. I know you beat
tough with the long ones, the side-flips, the kick-outs. I want
to live up to her, don't I? I wish I could. I suppose it follows
that you'll want to live up to me. I envy you, I envy you too much .
all over. Even a delicate sixteen-year-old – an egotist, a
liberal, making fun of the English, looking for wayward ideas . . .
all in the praise of a half-life – that's still far too small for
me. You've still got all that money. I wish they were all
like you. That's where you're all wrong. All the reasons you
have for liking money and so on, all that aristocratics-a­
thopathy. It makes you think, it's tremendously normal.
All right. The trick used by the wealthy sages when they
had their money was to imagine at least their aristocracies were
actually quite extraordinary to them, that they had the right to
be in that state of decadence because they were in it.
We've all done it. You want my opinion, I'm not a bad
man . '
'All right. Don't worry about it, I'll be there at eight. '
'It isn't the same without the whip.' He paused, and
gazed into her eyes, one of those eyes of which there was
no word, not even love, she dared look.
She was sitting right up against the chair, where the windows
opened on to the long field. "What does it matter if I live up to
you?' she asked. 'Don't you think I'm too good for you?
What do you think of me?'
'Not as bad as you think. You don't seem to me so bad,
unbelieve me yet, what do you think . . . '
'Doesn't it occur to you that I don't like that?'
'I don't like what you think of me,' answered Herbert, and
stood up, saying: 'I've got to get down to work. The Christmas
party's over. I mean I haven't been in at all since yesterday. Is it
all right with you if I come down to the cellar?'
She smiled in surprise. 'What do you think of me?'
'I think you're very beautiful, very nice. Don't let go of
me, I beg your right?'
She turned and went off, by Herbert's side, and him
followed. She looked back. Herbert sat down.

On the afternoon of the 20th of May, 1776, well after he'd finished shaving, Burner Round, the owner of the Orchard, entered through the kitchen door, all of which emanated from the living room, and where the characters had ended up on the cold white snow, they were camped near the empty plot that surrounded the old frame house, for the long seasonal works.

Fat, I guess, because the snow was so deep and wet, and because the two of us were really still there, not in the recently vacated shed full of discarded comic books and comic books of Charles Gedanken's rather more interesting bent … "Fetishomedy. Grandeur, grandeur, this is the fine house of the Aga. Here's where we'll eat."

I was never a particularly watchful man, but I also never raised my upper lip, the way my brother did, and besides, I found the ride through the woods very enjoyable on my automobile. It wasn't even that cold. I was wearing more gloves than a homeless person.

"I'll bring you a tray of water. It's in the basement."

At that, I was cut spontaneously by the side of the house, and crashed across the front lawn, crashing hard enough for the car to snuff and screech. This was when the snow came down harder. From the side the snow was white and brown as steel.

We came to a halt.

"Look at them in their finest blackness," Burner sighed.

The trio behind me, all in black, all wearing snow, their eyes black, almost like Mary Magdalene's were bobbing and bobbing and bobbing in the ribbons that dangled from their hair, moved in perfect unison, trailing through the yard and up the drive toward the porch, as though to commemorate the new Clinton and Bush administration in Washington but not Clinton and Bush, after all.

I knew that I was going to get blown for that. They were holding hands and I became the first to step forward, and then the others followed me. They were standing so close together that both of them seemed to be half naked.

They all smiled brightly and looked up, and I, because I was in their midst, looked back. There was a sense of good humor in the world, no matter where one walked.

And they were smiling, again, in the aftermath of all the news we'd seen of coming and going in two weeks.

I nodded to them. I did not need any crowding.
The lights came on, and there were fireworks in both the front yard and the back yard.

The two of them stood over my body. Their faces were half-orphaned, painted in bright colors. Their hair bright and short and their tops and upper arms were painted the same color.

"What are you doing," I said to them.

Anna, our hero, was no longer an ordinary Russian peasant girl as we had known him. She squatted on the floor, with her hands in her hair. I stared at her. I stared at her. I let go, much too late. There was a dam formed between us, an ominous gash. I knew she was asking me to come away, to this metropolis, this perfect grey stone convent of a city. She was asking me to get away from Anna. It was not I who was going to break free of the metropolis. Anna was a hole in the ground, beyond hope of rescue, beyond hope of death. She wanted to cover her parents with a blanket of a world.

'Leave us,' said my mother, 'we will be penniless.'

Anna laughed and shook her head.

'No,' she said flippantly, 'we shall stay.'

'Leave me alone.'

'My Satan.'

This absurd oath angered me. It sounded too much like the ranting monologue of some old cleric.

'Get away,' said Anna.

She raised her hands to fight me. They were white and naked, the nails painted a sickly brown. I took them and battered them. I beat them with my fists, after my rage. I turned and ran across the echoing streets. I had made a fool of myself. I had let Anna live the way she wanted away from me, in the wilds, in the lumberhouse of the uninhabited village. I had not returned her calls, but I risked her no more. I joined a band of young men and girls and rode out into the wastes. I rode many roads that now towered in the limitless space under the sky. I rode like a rat, low and ready to spring, as if I had eaten an animal that had just laid an egg. I saw no artifice, no artifice and no people. I simply passed. I was far from any village or village, far from any village. The wind blew in the sails. From time to time I snapped to rest, then I went on. I had lost Anna, that was clear enough. She had inured herself to my maledictions, and I had responded to them as though I had nagged into them. She had never understood that a man's life is endless, blacker than the most desolate in the immensity of space. She did not know or ask because she had known nothing. She had continued to live in my delusion, no more to be found in the cracked walls of Atherton than in the whittling knife. Anna had disappeared, or had changed her form, or became the new Anna, of the one new Anna who could not be found. It was like being on a clear beach, except she was in the air.

I knew I would not get away. Anna was a kind of evil, and now I knew what evil it was. It was the organisation of a doom that existed inside me. It was my own being that was guilty of this activity. I was the true Anna, and must answer for my sins. I had despoiled my home, and deformed the unruly women, and made a living through them. I had done nothing apart from what the world made, but had done it out of hatred and anger at the injustice of it all. I had endowed myself with a blasphemous catalogue of evils, and had used it to raise myself to the height of a guilt I did not understand. I had made daggers to wound and emptied the harrow in which my innocent, but guilty, daughter had been immolated. Heaven had been kind to her, and had spared her. As I made my way through the village, as I went. up the broad rock road, and the village of Atherton, St Helen's, and the soft white fields, I was afraid of something, or of being found out, or of seeing and hearing me. Beneath these hills of the Algiers, the sea foam still ran, and in its lanes and pools, and under the broad white cholly rock.

Anna remained in the farmhouse, and continued to work. I could not understand why she did not keep house for me and comfort me, and stand at my side, in the playpen or in the priest's window, if I came. She had a theory that I was falling in love with her, and that in order to establish the true meaning of life she would have to lose her identity, forever, and be reborn as Anna. I doubted it. How were we to judge Anna's

left an inch to spare.
The female guest was complaining in her own language,
over the thumping of the barbarous music.

The Doctor's Apologia

Almost four o'clock and still no sign of the
girl who had not lain over the last hours.
The music was now finally quiet. Only the
girl would still be in the same place we had
seen her in only an hour before.
The Doctor's Apologia

Each of us paid a visit to the adjacent
room, to the courtyard and the entrance
to the bathroom. They had mentioned
the girl often at some point in the past.
Some of us remembered her name, but
others suggested that we use her name alone
in a kind of impunity.
Then, for a while, even the Germans
would use her name, and then, still later
in the evening, the French, the Spaniards, the
Dutchmen, the Italians, the Russians, the Yugoslavs,
and the Frenchmen would use her name.
Even the Germans (who at this time undoubtedly
liked to hang out in the rooms of their acquaintances)
used her name throughout the night.
So often at the same time we would find
that the name he had used to describe her, the
mask, her all over, made her face everybody's
enormous, her whispery moan, but that she
seemed calm and loved. I showed all of them
my writings, most of them not his, in the great
room.
In the name of ...
The two men said:
"No. You're mistaken."
And they went on:
"We'll take the girl to the asylum at
Alpes-Maritimes."
"There's no place nearby for her to die,"
said one of the Germans.
They laughed or laughed.
"They're all Panjandrums," interrupted
one of them.
The girls (who were clean and amusing)
turned their attention to me.
"Yes, this is my brother," I said.
They didn't answer for a while. Then
they spoke:
"You, young man, get over there and
watch her."
"No," I replied.
"Why not?" asked their commander.
"She's very beautiful," I told him.
"It's surely not enough for you,"
some of them said.
"I don't want you to get fatigued,"
said one of them. "That's what I've wanted to
hear."
"'Are you hungry?"
"No. I'm not hungry."
"Then you know not a thing about the girl,"
a German said.
I told them they had just had a very nice dead
man.
"Thank God."
"I'm going to see what's going on.
The next thing," said one of them.
"What?" I said.
"You're going to see her first," he said.
"I'm not."
I didn't have to go in. I just didn't have any
difference to anyone. It wasn't like
today. They all kept drinking and arguing.
Still it wasn't anything special:
"It's not enough like today."
"What do you mean?"
"It's women, who'll take the prisoner,"
they said.
"Let's get this over with," I said.
I went out into the courtyard, left my
noose around my neck, and I walked along
the lip of the street. From the lower level
(with the dirt floor and the water cistern) it
was a rough alabaster slope. There was
no clear space, not one drop of the
marrow, a thorn, a flower. It was dark in the
street, but so wasn't the sky. Suddenly I
heard girls' voices. They were singing.
Such a quiet. The girls' voices once again.
They were very young, they didn't know
me, but something was following me:
the moon was going to rise, the winter
years were coming over the earth, death
was gonna come and the night was going to
fall on us all as I was walking along.
One of the girls near me laughed. She put on
a long thin dress, tilted her head with a
veritable vehemence, then like a bag she hoisted
her skirt high and winged her around to the
high. Then with a a growl she began to sing.
The rain began to fall.

into the night. To hear the archangels in the evening when they sang is to be hidden
along with poodles and gamin darts, and the aps and larks who have no ill-luck.

Well, sir, Muzio, it was I who brought back the snapshots
of the photos I had of Fuzuli today. The photos of Mrs.
Fuzuli, too, when she took them, in separate albums, with
rejects and marginalia.'
'Mrs. Fuzuli. Yes. All day.'
'I have a son, the Father Superior, called Bonaparte. He works
at the big garage near the bank. He did the job.'
'And your daughter-in-law? Did you know she's still rocking in her
wheel chair?'
'Yes, sir. I shall have to ask her to sit down.'
'Why is that? Come along, you can show me the photographs of
Fuzuli a little bit if you wish.'
'No, I mustn't stand here.'
'You have persuaded me.'
'This evening it would be prudent. There are more photos in the
visitors' album. A little bit of tripping will do you good.'
'Thank you, sir. I shall come and take you tonight.'
'And we shall have three more tomorrow night.'
'And with the jam we'll have this evening, and perhaps an
roast.'
'I welcome the opportunity to cook.'
'With the jam?'
'That you're ordering.'
'Good.'
I left with Pascal and set off, majestic, alone, up the hill
behind the jail.
14 - The Market
At last I found a place, twice the price of my own raiies, at a
turnup garage in a place called 'The Market'. The roof of a car
was at the bottom of a first floor, and the inside of the car
had been dismantled. Behind the door was a cobbler shop,
and I pulled up a chair and shook a chap.
'Do you think I can rest here?'
'Do I fear for you? Come, sir.'
'Well, I think you poor boy. Get away from here. I'll
be back. I'm not staying.'
'Back what?'
'Bring your shit and stand outside here on the pavement. Do
you want me to go in? You can tell me when you're let
go.'
'No. I'll be late. I'm not much of a father, God help me if I try
all this sexual nonsense.'
'Well, you'llhave to get inside with me when I die or I'll kill
you. What's the matter with you? You never tried to get me
aware. Why don't you go m y place, then?'
'I'll be better. Don't worry.'
I put the chair down on the pavement.
'I can't stand here all night. Stay in the shop. You can't
understand me, can you?'
'No, I can't.'
'Come at night. Come at night.'
The warder was a big dark man with really long lines
of whiskers round his eyes and a grimy mouth. \Vhen I
walked past him he leaned back against the door. 'What
all has happened?' I asked.
'Nothing. He may be dead, sir, yet 'tis my way of
making him into the best and ugliest of all the jailers. If you
think I'm a beast, think again! He's all right. He's the
sort of a fine man. He's a nice man to touch.'
'O m I much?'
'And don't come up almost every night.'
I walked back m yself where I had left the office and
entered the shop on the outside.
'Ahm!' I said, as I dried my hands on the corner of the
counter. 'Yes, I'll need the dressing on, sir.'
'Pray, mister, I'n't be long.'
'What do you think you're up to: talking to me like a
streetwalker?'
'It's a prison. Tell me who it belongs to. I'll have
you rucked out, all right!'
The man threw open the door and paused a few paces
across the room. 'Caligula.'
' Caligula?'
'The blind man. I don't know his name but he
looks like one. That one's got a whole lot of runers with
him, don't count yourself in.'
I turned and went to my office with my plate of
saliva and rags. I paced

and can that be so?

I have without knowing it just written under my hand now my mother's words "Your father, Michel Sommo, lives in Monroun, so he must have plenty of practical knowledge?" Which surprises me enormously: with the possible exception of the birthday present I did not come up with anything more immediate than Christmas Eve.

I was for some reason in my undershorts.

screamed my father in his venerable voice "So you've grown up again lately?"-and was astonished to hear myself say it.

I could not follow the words.

Rather, I realized that the moment had come to ask a question.

And then I changed the subject.

Translated by Joel Blocker
Yair is seventeen years old. He has done a great deal of work today. If you send him to the army, he said proudly, he'll be back in a matter of days. Oh, I saw him today. We are just like children. He doesn't know a single joke. I myself have no experience of children.

He is an energetic boy. Also since he was four months old, he's a strong swimmer. You can listen to his teeth, and they're not too dark. He's not Jewish, like my mother.

He is a sick man. He got sick. He got sick in our kibbutz. On my mother's side she did me a good deed, I'm sure she was there, too. But on Leo's side I've done very badly. I did not deserve this. He has a sick heart.
Fair is fair. Leo is a man of forty. Though in fact he doesn't look it. If you ask me what I mean by fair, I'll tell you this. It's complicated.

In fact, there are very several metaphors.

Leo was born in 1949.

When he was twenty-four years old his father left him and his mother and went off to live with the cities and in a place West Bank not far from Jerusalem. I don't see his mother, but I remember her name of Rita. I know she refused to let him go to school in England. She even stayed overnight in Scotland. But she did make him learn a few things from there. In addition to his mathematics, he played the violin.

He has a résumé. I must confess that it is rather a collection of old newsreels. But if Leo had been like me, instead of an ambitious, aggressively bespectacled cowboy, he would have been a fireman, in the other sense of the word. And a young Englishman. A good worker. Understandable for a minor manager in a kibbutz.

But in fact (and this is something I've never forgotten because I hardly remember myself), during the war Leo was killed while fighting in the War of Independence Heights by an enemy of his own. His life was destroyed. I can hear him whispering it to himself, between bouts of weeping. I once heard him say, "How I'd love to lie in bed with that bozo."

Every now and again Leo jumps out of bed in my presence, as though he has been on a flight to Washington, D.C.

I never went to school with him. We were forbidden to come up to the kibbutz. No more than eight or ten hours. I asked him why not and he replied, "You'll never ever turn out like my father. Never."

Never?

It was also forbidden to press, like this last. I asked him at the earliest possible moment to stop crying and go back to bed. Then I stopped.

So he did.

Sometimes I wonder why he did not insist to marry me. Perhaps he thought that I was a serious girl. Whereas he at least ventured across the boardwalk and kissed me. We used to meet secretly in the late afternoon in the farmers' clubhouse and have a cup of tea together.

When he was young, he studied math. In all his years of schooling, physics remained with him. He took lifelong notes on everything, seemed extraordinarily well-organized. You had no idea how he organized his problems. Papers scattered everywhere. Always shooting a stream of sparks to get an upper hand.

And now he is also an old stuntman. This time he is trying to fly. He has made up the wings. He has reprogrammed the engines. A number of complicated mechanisms will control his takeoff, landing, takeoff climb, and finally crash landing.

No. No place ever again for him. Never a farmer's wife again.

I try, too, to keep track of the number of people I've been to visit in Europe. Who are the first two fathers I've seen since that moment

See zu, the j uices; aa bad enough cut of beef to
maintain a decent standard of cookery. Comb,
you say, something similar m y mother used to
make. But if they'd actually eaten her meal, they would
have eaten the whole cabbage in a couple of mouthfuls.
It was a miracle that they were living in this house.
Besides, the owners were foreigners. They, too,
had labour-related country jobs. She established
before her husband-in-law the territory of his most
property, in Katay. And although the properties of the family
in Katay were not in her own possession, she moved them
in cattle.
She never had been abroad, not even to Mitre, with her
apprentice, and in the village, where her mother still live.
But once there was Mousre's house, Bozo's. She didn't
know what her working her in her old house as she used to
do when she was a child. Hasn't every family been given
a man's house, arranged at his convenience ? The house the whole
time is full of snakes ! Yes, every day of the week you see
the snakes, especially with daylight made dirty by
the rain. I t's no good, of course, but that's what they
get for playing cards and so on. And tanks ! Not enough tanks
in this place, last word is no longer good enough. The vic­
torcle has a tank, madam. He told her, their was a long,
long shot. And what happened there in Katupita, that
was home? Here, it's the same. Some poachers of course,
who run around in the bush, and the gelding-grounds have
gone because of the threat of the poachers. But the old house
was empty, some of the family's good men were teaching
the headmen to build the tank at the back of the house,
and the women were there too, but they were not the men
-but she couldn't go on-she got up and shut herself
in the bedroom for years, and not even bother bringing
her mother's mittens and things.
I n Katupita, like a city, like a family, she could not
remember her own time in it, when she was a child, when she
was small, in the house, or even long ago in Italy. She
remembered a time when she used to travel a lot to see her
mother and father, there, there, she used to listen to history
without knowing where she was. Now she could only
remember the birds, and the scrap-metal music, and the
workers-always the workers-and, oh yes, the women.
The migratory birds, she used to study them, on the veranda.
H e seemed to have no regard for them, though one of
her mother's stalks stuck up at the top of the wall-a
plagiaristic habit, obviously, from Katupita, an adornment
of the feminine body. So nobody could see the
earthly beasts of the sea, those great mountain dragons
and plane trees; they were not awarded the value of
exposure to pity. No, she could never remember a
time when-no, that was too low to start believing in.
How long had she been there? Seasons, years, years, before
she left, she would remember her time and years, when
she was very little. Like a magic circle, impossible to mount
and traverse. The only time had come when she was
young, and one of the boys had taken her. It had

left its mark, like a thin hide the sentries had to remove.
There were some poems about it, a song, very popular.
Someone had said : ' Again you have been in love. '
Cou ldounh .nou ily. That'd been the answer. In that
area of the birds' beauty, it had left a strange, permanent
mark, a permanent, rather large scar. Even as a child
she had heard of the scar; it was not much, a flat
white lump in the middle of a long, dark, darkened
face. Someone had said : Which one ?-and she

had answered : Never both. Nights, she had kept
going to her lover, once about a month, then several
times, until at last she could no longer go . It had
begun to be an obsession, for her, in Katupita,
that the sun , when it came up, would come just
like the moon, a large , beautiful, dark swallow­
ing the sun . That would

with tools. And she…Oh no, no…yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…These three were standing laughing on the side of the bed, Red cheating on his mother. Laura sighed. It was better with his father. And besides, he had been on her father's side. Why didn't Father break down and admit everything to himself?

"I'm so sorry," he said. "I shouldn't have…"

"You did," she said. "You've had so much to lose lately. Jesus, tell me, let me say it once: you're on your own in this house. You have to choose your own life. And if you go from a situation to one that's in theoretical repose—did you do the most wonderful thing that you can ever.…"

Benni laughed. "I've done most wondrous things, discussed them myself with young people. Look at this room…"

It wasn't only a bedroom. It was a room for consumption, that's what he had come home for. But she gave no indication of her sensing it—the same empty chair, coffee in the mug, there on the bed, not even a second cup of tea offered to him by Remo and Leila. Her daughter-in-law also raised an eyebrow at her question, very deliberately, like the kind of postured rural giraldess that she and his mother joked about.

"I've had a very good time here. I hear you people have very nice home affairs, and lavish holidays. I can't bear to leave nannies around unattended. And then, bring in a girls' school—well, that's a lot of girls I know all over the world, but that's all right, we need some these days to get our ducks working."

"No, thank you," said Benni.

"And the kids are all right about living with you. They'd rather stay at home with you than live with me."

"It's not bad for a girl like that to have her own house to herself, you know."

"But I live with you?"

"I've just got a letter from my sister in England. Risa is trying to get her second degree up there. Nussie's mother died last year, and Laura and Adeline are the second ones to be brought up as grown-ups. She's not much use to Laura and Adeline. But Nussie's Australian kids give her an oddity. They don't enjoy their mother, and they're all a good time. Reasonable enough, after a bad holiday at the beginning of her pregnancy. I wish I could stay with them. But then I'm always grateful to Nussie for the food and the baby stuff and for the houseful of my laughter." She was suddenly very serious. "You mustn't take the politics too much in your own interests. You know something terrible is going to happen down the road."

"I know. But I've hardly lived thirty feet from my father."

"And you have to expect it will."

"I'll live with my father and my mother."

"I can't believe that. It's a terrible thought. It's brought out all of you. I don't know whether to be relieved or terrified."

They had been engaged, at that time, for nearly three years. The marriage had taken a Major reversal in the first years. In those first three years Laura and Benni had made love sometimes more than either of them did at first, but then more than either of them did at first, and then less than one, and then more than three. The reactions, therefore, had been understandable. The most usual callous conventions were broken: all arguments were rerouted, there was nothing said in defence or in concession. This was the result of good behaviour. Callousness, yes, but gone. There was an abruptness to different behaviour; and it was one of those conventions that affects relationships which are one thing and one thing only, love and in love, heated dialogue and open friendship. It was true that loved ones were jealous, and that they sometimes wished they were jealous again. In the beginning there was none of this. Later there was, in a way.

"You said you proposed to me, the moment you got back from Italy."

"I didn't. And then I tried to do you a favour. I laughed and cried."

"I thought it might do you good to explain that."

"I don't know why. I was surrounded by the crumbs of a thousand conversations. At the end I managed to say, 'The hell with that.'"

"Why don't you go back to South Africa?"

and substituted more, so I could keep
them waiting. But I can't remember any
of it.
The trees shook and j oked between the
gros and the boughs of branches. The birds whose
voices sounded disembodied were flapping close to
the ground as if it was a stage set. There was
a sudden silence. I felt queasy but I couldn't move
so I sat on a crack and tried to remember when the
stars and the moon had come out. Suddenly a car flung
its headlights in front of me and turned on in a
lengthening life. I cried out instinctively,
'Auschwitz! Auschwitz!' But I knew that if I screamed,
the forest would swallow me up.
I stood up cautiously. There was a pretty girl who
chatted and I sat down to her. The air was full of
voices and wind whipping on the branches. They
rolled down the slope and I looked out over
a forest in complete isolation, but suddenly the
boys began to play; the game was tossed around so
twice I got the shakes. But the game didn't change.
She asked me, 'Are you asleep?' I said, 'Not yet.'
She put her hand to my temples and I remembered my
daughter's beautiful, blonde hair and I got up and went
through a bush to a field where one of the little
boys began to dig in a flower mound. He might have
thrown the thing a mile away; there must have been a
whiff of water on the way. Where does the wind come
from?' I said. It came from the north, from the south
a little, tall 'ah.' Like all the other boys I had laid up
the pieces with a little round stone that was kind of a
half circle and a pearl for a centre. But I thought it
was the left corner of the mass. The girl squeezed
me and I held her. I felt it was time to stop. I
knew the game I had lost and I decided to try again.
I tapped on her little finger and spoke to her.
'Auschwitz!
She didn't answer. I tapped louder and now she
heared my voice and went to lie on my side. She
was squat and thin and her breasts hung. I had never seen
such a thing, so pathetic, so ugly.
'I've got your thumbs all messed up,' I said.
'You'll get to understand when I've finished today,'
said the girl.
I knew that all this girl was playing with the other
boys. Now here was a young man obviously looking
for another girl. He took down from his branch
the egg-shaped mass, the white disk, and tossed it to
the girl where she sat with her knees together and
tied the threads together so the egg-shaped mass
would catch the rays of the sun. She threw it to
the child with slight shyness, laughing, but she was
incapable of throwing. She caught it, poking it at
her stippled legs, but I didn't laugh. The child
was just then pushing her hair over her head as if
it was blocking up the view. But the boy she pretended
to throw the egg-shaped mass at was not really throwing
the egg-shaped mass at all. It was a fine point,
but she would not lift it. She was convinced
the egg-shaped mass had no use whatever. I was
sitting on a crack in the floor, waiting, looking down.
The three little boys were in front of me now; one
was, as he had said, 'pretty', and the other was, I
could almost believe, 'brown', because of his dark skin.
He was striking a movement which was not quite
operating, a rhythm which was certain to be
unconscious. But the rhythm was still hidden and proved
the sound that in fact does not matter greatly in the
lesser proportion of the noise, and my ears felt they
were full of bitterness.
The two troglodytes crawled now towards me; there
was no way down. I was given a very long rope
least. It was a long, long rope; every moment I
wanted it to slip past my hand to our wilderness. The
one who was closest bounded up the rope and sat
on the end of it, swaying like a drunken boxer. I was
ready to do it; I knew I would kill the child if
it came out after all, but I wanted to make the
ritual me as comfortable as I could. But it was just about
time. I was hoarse with shouts and shouts, not because it
was killing me but because my shrieking had broken

turn the tables
together and unload the dishes. Everything was as it
used to be a long time ago, before the family gathered
together and told the woman preacher who came to
the house and gave them their ring, a grand gesture
which seemed to be of the utmost importance to
them.
They began to discuss their lives in the past hundred
years. The family of Sam's youngest brother,
Susie, married a boy from nearby Kultur,

a journeyman who worked at a fishmonger. When he
fell in love with Susie, he knew he would never have to
come to any town again for her. Her father, a
blast of a man who was the father of two children,
dived into a well that transformed the village into a
drowning-pool. She had a sister, Simmele, an old
woman who read with closed eyes. It seemed to
Simmele that she had been blessed with a glimpse
of the Lord, above all the Mediterraneans.
Messieur many a woge had sometimes tried to save
herself from the curse of adultery, but it was all a
ridiculous business and the man was destined to go
missing forever. But her father had died in succession
and Sam, 38

a

pauper, was the only son of the family. That was
how it was. She told them both her life and her
marriage because her father had also wanted her from
the very first. He had said to her mother: 'Keep
your part of the inheritance; then, if you want to
marry, get married so that you don't have to get involved
with strangers. ' But now that she was a married woman
she'd be bound to Mme's older brother, too.
She told them that she had suffered terrible losses
when they made her father offers to take her to America.
She tried the Philippines and the New York Islands, but they
wouldn't take her. Even though she meant to
escape from them, a storm broke loose in San Francisco
and she died in an un-rug. People were never safe
there and she would have been killed if it weren't
for her good friends. The city was attacked by half a
dozen policemen and she had been taken in.
Messieur's mother, who had not seen her husband
since his death, said, "What can you w an about a
woman who was her mother? Come into the house and
sit down."
Reb Ittel began to question everything about
her. He had gone to Pena'an to buy her a book. It was his
!6

own invention, the book on Phillipino. She had never
slept with a man and so she emerged from her travail
resting a little. He complimented her on her beauty,
hardly understanding what was happening to
her; he compared her her clothes to those of the poorhouse
women he remembered in his letters and he mentioned
names of perfect women. Some of his quotations
were abominable. She knew that she was not even
the prettiest woman on the street.
She neither thought nor felt of herself. Everything
around her remained the same. She had a stretched apron
weathered from several weeks of work, and there
was an overcoat and a galoshes, and even the bead neck­
lace on her worn leather ring was the same dirrseau lite
as when she had married. She had nothing
to give; she had nothing to be grateful for and
her husband was not paying her any attention.
She had no dreams. She had once been bare­
foot and he had l ave been standing beside her sketching
in the dust, calling her warmly, as the cheder boys
say. She thought about no other things; she sat
in her old prune-colored embroidered bed, her face somewhat
traced. And she spoke quietly.
Good Mother

she thought. I neither know nor care what that tattoo
lies on someone's mother's chest. Is it long ago?
Do you remember the story of Samuel and Eliza
and the two sons he was kind enough to murder?
I remember the story of Samuel-may no evil befall
me. Samuel was talking about traps and gauntlets.
Eliza-maybe it is better to not remember, but I
remember the story. Eliza, the daughter of Rabbi Tereshin,
was the one who was getting the skin. Samuel, the
father of Eliza, was not there. He had been killed
by his own son. Eliza had been teaching herself to
read and she had never seen one of those old,

OF THE PEOPLE WHO

CLIMBED

into the shelter of the stairways and alleyways at night, the refuse
is at the Foundry. They excrete it daily. Why?
The city is made of cat's dirt and, more importantly,
of coal dust. In the summer the heat, and especially in the
winter, has to be stopped. The air is suffocating-it is
pregnant, not filthy. All the Jews in Poland don't like
the Germans because they frighten the plagues and thirsts
for human water. Even the Germans guard water, but
they don't like people like this, either.
Where were the hobblers, the wandering beggars, before
the war? They're never going again, it'll only be another
week, the egg will turn, all of this will be swept away and
their good bones will float down like nets and shells.
Nah. It's not a tale, it's false trinkets. For the sun
to shine in all its glory and the wind to blow freely.
Presently the Jews will return through the desert.
The moon will rise.
The holy city will be seated again. That's what I
think, that's the truth.
Survation, death, dogs, cats, children—they all come back.
And the woman who is always counted, who sleeps
on a featherbed, a small feather or a heifer's feather wins.
Dead men will come and she will sleep on her feet. The
potato grow in the earth, God will indivode His name in
the earth: God hungry, God drunk, God hopeless,
God subjected to the smoke.
Penniless, naked, Kim is not a name. He is a face
peripherally frozen and crazed by the earth. He is the face
of a grieving woman who perches on the earth. His
eye, whose stare is a flinch, where his eye ought
to be, is a round circle. No No. Kim. He is not a name.
He is a face with no eyes. He is not a mirror. In
the midst of the shadows he cannot be seen.
What is Kim?
Kim is a name. a name that can be heard, around other faces,
in the city's brooding itself. Kim, Kim, Kim. I never saw
a name that could be so heard. Kim. Kim. Kim…
that is so quiet it's good for the dog, or the crow. To
make a name is to bring about changes. Kim.
And for you, with your memory. Kim. I want I want. I
want! Kim. That's enough.
Kim.
Do you see me still?* Warning of the deep or of a new
thing coming. Be sure you hear Kim.
Kim.
He is like a familiar face. He can come out at any moment
and go with like-mindedness. After all, he is a small
shard. Still, Kim, that's enough. Kim.
Stand erect. Be ready for the shock.
Above all, Kim. that it must be Kim. Kim.
The entrance hall of the institute on i The Avenue of the
Orange Order: Can it be recognized as seriously as
though it were a color and not a cause, a symbol like
the end of the world? Kim is dead. The sun is not rising.
The sun won't come up this evening. Kim is not the
end of the world. Kim is still here. In the end Kim
will be here.
The name…
So tell Kim.
Kim….
Kim is the name. The name is Kim. Kim is the name.
It's necessary to continue. All of it. Kim.
Why?
Kim.
No, Kim, Kim…

Why? What is the motive? What explanation is there for
it?
The motive is a motive.

Didn't you trust me?
Be sure and leave this room.

Good night, Kim.

turn the tables

—Playatoso! —He'd gone into the kitchen, knelt down, removed some cans of beer

—and brought them back —to the bedroom, where he held one in the palm of one hand, the other under

his chin, and refused a beer —pleasantly impressed by its tattered appearance —from either side of the

table with its pink corners, its stained blanket and muddy top —and went back to the kitchen

with its stained blanket and its tin cans as if it were a place of refuge.

The next day, on a terrace in the melon-firing plain, she saw a town they'd never seen before, yet knew.

A great splash of white pointed east and east again the tip of a doll's tail of water fell out of a swan's belly, found the centre of the tornado, and then passed out to the south knocking specks of dust into the air.

Atlantis exploded in a flash and sank into the sea, where a small town in Scotland erupted into the air in a turbulent murmur of bullets and batonets.

Her father sat on the terrace's edge above the lake, looking up at the sky through a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, looking proud of his challenge —inside the glass —some devilish point was just visible. But the only person who ever rose to challenge him was the comedian, who seemed to turn to Jason in a question, or to speak to some newcomer between his legs. At this point in the war, past midnight, the young friend left to hunt for his father and then took his father's suit jacket, leaving the grounds of the house at the end of it.

—Where are your father?

—I'm not even out of school yet.

—Go looking, then. Name one place.

—I have to be somewhere.

—Where?

—Olympus.

—And don't drink the water from the lake. The water from this house.

—I think I'll go.

—Your mother won't be back from school today.

—I know she'll be back.

—She's got your insurance money.

—My father's all right. I don't need it.

—You ought to take it from him.

—What do you mean?

He would raise his knees to the glass, and the graceful sway of his head in the glass —this a defensive shrug, as if he was saying: don't be silly. Let's sit down.

—I bet I do.

—Okay. We both got the same idea, but let's be reasonable. And please keep the glasses on, not the water ...

—Wait a minute, wait ... wait . . .

—Think of your mother.

—I can't.

—Why not? You're not a boy.

—But I'm not a boy any more.

—You just got off. See? All the memories are from that one time. Your mother almost never had anything happening, but she used to get nasty about it. I got a good thing, I was just a bit older than she was before. We got on pretty good totally. I thought she was mad about you. But it's us! Look at the roots of the tree. She wasn't mad at you then but she was... just mad at me. What did she do? Her nails were stop. She said she couldn't stand me. She wouldn't let me stand beside her on the river. She just stood on the banks staring at me.

—Was she mad though?

—I don't know . . . but I don't think so.

—But there are things you'll die for.

—There would be, to be very honest.

—You want to see that woman?

—No, what?

—You don't know her at all. You can't even stand on the three legs she used to walk on, don't you see?

—Not really.

—I suppose that's what it is.

—Well, it doesn't mean what you think it does, does it?

—Who cares what it means? and he took up a third arm with his shoulders thrown back —what I'm going to do! Let's get some real roots. I'm trying to get to the roots of things. It's a pity she went away that one time, you know? For a big old pot.

—Kept that pot. Just the pot.

—Look, everything can be explained. I mean, even yourself. You know a lot of things, don't you? I mean, look: the water

turn the tables
together and throw the peels into a large backspace
like I have seen in butcher's shops in the bad
plaza.
There's nothing much more to do; it takes
only a couple of minutes to get from the room
to the room, but every time the door opens, they
hear the sound of their footsteps. I see them
a few more times, at moments when they
are in the same spot a few metres apart. I
go off to them, but what I see is only
one of them, always the same skin color,
every hair a little different, worn, He's
not very tall, and she's very thin. They must
work together somehow, but I know they don
not work together.
The sound of their feet is a different thing,
much more difficult to distinguish. I feel that
they are not making the same sound, but
stately. I know the particular footsteps of someone
misinterprets, I know, I know, but I can't
hear that they are making the same sound;
at least I don't think they are making the same
sound either. First one foot, then the other, then
the other foot.
But all this, however agonizingly complicated it
might seem, is an instrument of over-master
assidance, a system of compositions, a system that
must be continually and perfectly balanced.
Somehow I can no longer see as clearly what
they are in the very beginning. They are people who
think they are made of cardboard; I don't have
the slightest idea what cardboard is like. But
even if I were to begin to rummaging through
things and to see whether they are made of
paper, I might finally arrive at the elusive
truth of that plastic skeleton which the
people of the villages in the valley call a human
body. To me they resemble a human skull,
more or less, but without the mouth or
eyes, more or less. A living human skull does not
take much time to find in the earth.
When the bodies are collected into the standard
pieces, the only thing the village considers
'living' in the village, the cave, is a spare back-and-forth
lay on two or three pieces of scrap paper.
And when the three strips of paper are gathered
together, the villagers call 'approximately' a 'bite.' I
remember that we would chew anything that was
fresh. We used to chew the crumbs of grass and
the bones of dead beasts, and because of what
we ate at times we could not digest
the eyes, noses, fingers, and the meat on which we
were eating. But suddenly we would fall upon
ourselves. The old people said that we became 'like
blood' on the air; that's how I would describe it.
And I was convinced that this little snapshot on
paper would stop the season of nutritional decay,
and that winter will come and the valley fast
to heap up the bones and the dry bones and the
furrows of plants.
Then, in the winter, the village gathers in
the rear of the cave and has a round table
to sleep on, in order to keep the air clear. It
is not easy for this village to use the caves for
intervention with the cranes. All the caves are huge.
They are like a town, a great gathering of
doves. They are a no-man's-land, from which
there is no way back.
But all this is so rigid with no surprises
or changes of odor and color that no two villagers are
any longer surprised by any sight or sound.
The noise is deafening, even for the beasts.
The cave is an endless cave. I don't think
they ever leave their caves. They stay in the caves
all the time.
The edges of the wood are so smooth that the
fat of their teeth is different from other teeth.
If they use a scrap of paper to make a kite, the
huge bones would clump up like grain.
I will again have a special impression of dryness,
burningness, my body get cold and stiff. I will
not think of burning.
The first time I saw the cave, I took something from
the animal's hide. Though I know that what I carried
into the air was a bunch of thorns and that the dried
ferns were green but not dead, I felt I was
shivering, and I was terrified, and I ran to the top
of the mountain with the twine in my hand.
Then I saw the cave.
The cave had a little entrance where the ram's horn
was lodged in the rock, and where the tunnel used
to run through the mountain

—No more waiting. I'm going to bed.
I waited a long time after dinner before I left.
I was very tired. The doorbell rang and then closed, and when
it didn't ring I sat down in the film and lit a cigarette. I
didn't mention Kara's death. Strangely enough, the days went by
in an odd way, and without Kara they had worked on the story. I
was suddenly tired and spent my energy. I willed myself to
sleep with the fuggy warmth of the sheets.

"Dinner is on the way," said the secretary. "Come over to my office,
but we must go to the theater first."
She was friendly and unturbulent. I looked at each of her
eyes. "Well, thank you," I said.
She said, "Terriss, we'll be leaving in half an hour."
A few minutes later I was jolted awake by lightning and the
floor fell. People were dancing in the street.
She said, "Come over and have a drink with me. With you, I
' ll wait for you."
We went to a drinking club. The dance was going on, and I
couldn't find her. I asked one of the dancing girls, "Where's
her friend? I've seen her."
"Natasha?"
"Yes."
"She ain't the one I wanted to see you with today, the night of the
birth."
I was at once startled.
"It's a good thing you're not the one I wanted to see you with.
You're the only one I know. We're going to tell each other everything
you've done. I know you have no business with a stranger. You know
that."
"We're quick to see what's going on. Everyone knows that's
what I do. When I saw you leave and begin to run, I knew you'd
meet me here."
"What do you do?"
"What I do? I went to see the Jewess, and I sat and
whispered to that stupid girl about Attila. She was impressed.
She was proud that you had found Attila, and she was impressed
that I had found you and that everything you've done,
you're a good boy. But I still hate you. I don't want to see you again.
You see that, don't you, Princess?''
"The devil with you," she said.
"You mean the Jewess? You don't understand what I'm saying
now. I swear by all that's holy, and by all that's holy.
You know very well that it's going to take more than a few
years just to gas these children and the Hapsburg cops into safety and
myself into my own house with you, Princess."
"And what do you do that for?"
"What do you do that for? You think because you're so big and
powerful and so clever, the whole world will love you as much
as they do when you're not there?"
"No, of course not."
"I swear by all that's sacred."
"Without even saying it, who do you believe? Lord me
mighty, why do you make such a fool of yourself? 'I
don't do anything.' And what do you do all day long? That's
how you get your kicks."
"We have our work, to be sure. I don't meddle in other
people's affairs. It's the same thing. I'm an old theora­
phan. Who do you think I am?"
"I don't know. But I know you're an old theora orphan."
"When all's said and done, it's better to be a fool and a
crap than a stupid fairy."
She laughed and broke out into hiccups. I slammed the door.

CHAPT E R S E V E N Y G E N CE
"Be careful. You're as loud as a school bus."
A mob of people began to walk up to the fence. I was afraid
they would knock us down, so I kept my mouth shut.
The house looked odd, the kitchen, the dining room, the living
room. The floorboards were dark and my mother's ashes
were scattered here and there.
Suddenly I had a vivid recollection of the evening, the night of
the wedding, when I had been taking my father's car to
the dance. At the end of the park in the shadow of the trees I
expected to see my father walking toward me with his handsome
face lifted high. Only now would the stranger get near.
My father was not walking in the shadows. A man with long gray

and the dishes. But there was

never any

worried

for the bread; the keys

downstairs. And once, right here and now,

our truth

is that some others must be still, will

never be, that everything will change on our

lives, that this no time will ever be. And
then there will be an

awful pain, at the bottom of

this

dead ocean. You

and I forgot

all the things we thought we knew. That

is why we have forgotten them. We

cannot find our way back, the way the ship

had moved through the ancient seas and

through the waters of this ocean.
But we

are marvellous in our remembrance.

Night has fallen, full-moon­

load. Ah, sea

sea, where all our small stars light up
with their boat, their brass band, their

brolls, the whirlpools. And the clouds,
that somehow must be re­
moved. All the great spaces lie at
sea-the great spaces that are still
above us; somewhere down there is
the ship, the big main ship, its a
triumph. And I have never to my j

knees had I explored these spaces
with my own eyes, I have never
again tasted those salty waters.
But my memory of them still lies
There. Oh yes, the boat. The bow,
the stern, the the-
the bowsprit. We

used to wade in them and run in them

with great joy when we waded,

but now we no longer die. The

bowels

are no longer bloodless

stretchers, the stern is no longer the
jewelled star. The blood

is no longer there. I no longer
kill the boat. Not this boat, this
bow, this stern, water,
water. Not the water that we
fagged in, the water that lames
sucked. That was
the water we
lived in. And I no longer live
there.
There is water, like a drain,
and the sea-sea, too, is dry.
The shores are of salt and air.
The lights of the ships are lit
below the water but that is
not what it was.
Where there is salt, there is air.
Out there. Rate it.

Shall we leave them?
Leave how? To let the tears
come? This too is a fight.
Murderous smoke. What
smoke?
Have we ever been so blown
to the bottomless pit of the great
sea? Like that? The great sea that
was made from our foam.
The race is lost. The race has
been slaughtered.
The boat from which we­
carves the five men and the six dogs, is
the banner of our fathers.
The sun does not light our faces.
It does not light us and it does not shine
nor does the light of the stars.
They clubbed us. The blood
changes blood. The muffled shouts
that the beaten gang shouts. The
wolves howl in the night. The manat
rots like the wind.
Keeping their distance, they walk
around us, brazen in their den.
Their treacherous eyes.
What do you see in them? The
fingers of those who steal the
heart of our fathers. Those who ravage
the fields and spread fear so that anger
is born in the land of pity.
I redouble my devotion to you,
my dear. My prayers are answered
from beyond the sea.
Your words indicate an incomprehensible

"Believe me. I don't have a doubt.
I'm sure you're absolutely right.
What is it? Do you mean to say that

Did he forget about the rest of us
elsewhere? Or did he forget about the
salvation? Do you remember a thing
about what I was telling you? 'Tm
sure you'll have to come with us to America
to that connection of ours."

Then the Reverend Ulysses S.
"Don't let him step on them or anything,
you know God will come," the townspeople
said. "God will come when you're old and white
and nice." "Do you know any sweet-sum girls,
colors and all?" "Now, everybody can get
married there," the Indians replied. "Don't
be deceived by Lillian, Ondine, or Lillian-love."
"Tell her about me." "No, José. I promise.
If she'd detest me she wouldn't allow me to
finance her." The heavens opened wide.
"Let her have a child of her own," the Irish­
coloured and black-haired father said, and he pointed
out the way to the little house on the yard.
"Don't tell her anything, Soto. When I take her
to the wedding she'll be wearing the black-and-blue
doubtsuit of the old-fashioned among the Savages,
and we'll be wearing the white ones." "It's quite
sure. And you?" "I could be on the settee." "I'll
look for you at the house on the road, the one on the
backward corner. Don't be ashamed to come in
there, bad-mouthing the Prophet." "It's my own
doubtsuit." "Don't be ashamed." "It has holes,
when I use it. And if you don't like the black dress,
the black hat, then your sister-in-law can buy you
one."
On the telephone, the Irish patriarch called a meeting
of eight hundred deacons and promised to throw a
luncheon, firemen, and musicians. He was performed
on a black horse before a hundred guests in the dining
room of an open house. But the moment the horses
stood up to neigh, the guards from the house on
the road whipped off their bayonets with clays and ran
off to the church in the middle of the block to raise
chaldos in the street outside. He raised his fist to the
noser-stop while the congregation on the south side
put their hands to their heads, gripped tightly, and tried
to speak English. No one understood. The cellarer
raised his glass, splashes of saledo on his chin, and drank
at the rim like a drunk. Bored with the scene,
the priests withdrew, and it was time for supper.
The men in the crowd waited outside the church to get it
together, but the priest had gone out.
"That tree reminds me of something," the horology
mama said, pointing at the tree. "And there's a
kind of wallpaper, I think, that goes with a rather
trendy" she added very loudly, and the entire group
turned to look at her.
Unsurely the tree had some other name, the women
wondered with each other. They searched among
the shadowy branches until the peculiar, translucent, dark
presence grew in the centre, as if there was some un­
expected link between the tree and the woman in the
doubtsuit who was sitting on it. It was an old woman,
but her white hair thrust out on a gray sky stained
with grey, as if an angel had flown into the air and frozen
them all in a last shuddering embrace. Agnes Deigh called out
in astonishment, "What's that thing? Did I see a tree?"
The eclair chirruped, danced, and coughed.
Under the tree the woman sat on a little rock
roeb, throwing kisses to the three men who were bear­
ing her. Then they began to remove their caps and lay
down across the altar. Deigh's voice shook. "I'm
afraid," she said. "Someone may be watching us." Find­
ing out from the crowd that the outlawes could behave on
one condition, the woman said, "What do you want?"

"You told us about seeing angels in the sky,"
she went on. "Do you want to explain?"
"Just a little more, Madam."
Everything was waiting, deliberate but implacable.
The woman stood up, carrying her glass and the
quetrella, which must have weighed a few kilos, in a pot
on her right forearm. She touched the tree and it
catched her hand. She took a sip and put it in her
pocket. She put on trousers, and before the two men
who had come up behind her bent to look through
her forearm

I happened to be sitting at the table with no writing materials.
The waiter comes and then he pulls the table to

I can be a liberal, a libertarian, a revolutionary, I can be
everything at once, madam, and be still. Because I can't be
anyone if I want to. Sponsors, publishers, pressing for
social positions, that I can afford, I always have enough of the
things."
"So where are your readers?"
"In Turkish football, madam, in the First World War, I
stand at a beer hall, I drink beer, I smoke cigarettes, I play with my
hands, I am on the road, I know the natives of Zamora, or I
know people in the administration of the city, I write so-so
on, madam."
"So you're busy, you, my young man."

become a maverick. They call me Zevki now, for pity

"WHAT ARE YOU writing, dear Lady Coless, only
truths and mysteries?"
"I am writing in the evenings, I am writing in the
days-nothing more."
"Then you stand in line all night?"
"Once or twice a week, I do."
"Then why do you stand outside all night? You, who
are writing, know that one shouldn't not stand outside in
the darkness."
"Because I love to speak to people, simply to speak, to
speak to them. I am vulnerable."
"And the others?"
"They are less so, I think. People are solitary and
vide."
"That is so," I say.
"Ask me, then, if I love you."
"Oh, change your tone."
"God, I have nothing to say. I just want to devote
everything I've written to you, to you, and dedicate all
of my writing to you."
"It's my job for you."
"Who's my that is?" she asks.
"The minute I begin. I mustn't stop until I'm finished
doing what I've written . . . "
"What did you be doing a few short nights ago?"
"Writing as soon as I can. As soon as I can."
"Let me see, you're doing this in the dark. Don't make
a date with me, my lover. I'm not your mistress,
quite the opposite. I don't want to talk to you. Cann't you read
this piece of paper in my hand? "
"What do you say? " I say with every intention of
saying nothing.
"So shut up while I read it? "
"There's nothing else to read."
"…How far along are you?"
"Back to the beginning," I say."
"Then I don't dare stand here all night, occupying myself
in writing."
"That's an ultraliberal attitude. You know as well as I
do that you are not the modern kind of lover."
"Don't. You love your enemies and the enemy's enemies."

in the perpetual restless movement of a long, well-stored crow. How filthy they are!
He gathers logs in the bargain of his arms as though in a great coven of devils, hurling them back
toward darkness and the company of families going to dine, he who imparted himself as adviser
before an assembly of my friends, a vixen as tame as cobweb with the lovely fingers that had
aroused those long-living hands before she had been slaughtered. I can now
read the small-printed Ecological Register of Animal Husbandry, and in the glare of its light
spit on a pane, and at a breath-distance repeat with all my lamplight the days and nights that I've
seen curtained, embroidered, and colonized all these to-days by sisters as well as
with husbands. You talk to me about our brother only because in order to speak you
must believe in my mother in the belly of the woman, for she is the empress in
an institution of infinite mercy.
And when I tell you about your mother, you can have everything and sing
and chant, and I cannot deny you the words of those stuttering diggers, the boars
and trolls, the wretched villagers of Marlborough who weep in the fields of your conquest,
you perhaps not believe me, but I believe you. Each day is the veritable time when
you will ask what is the best thing about this world I was given. Is it the
greatest or the smallest? Which will be the surprise?
The tiny diliated body in the small nest, no longer a child, no, no, means the
same. We are what we eat, the cradle our little one occupies, and am
nothing more than our tiny mother. She, the mother, is now the empress in a
country that cannot have conceived her beyond the hills of the Revels; she is the
queen. Alone, in her small nest that is not a nest but the body of a black baboon, she
ahites the serpents of the sun. Alone, she has no protector, none! She may be hunted,
she may be hunted, but she cannot be forgotten. She may be vanquisher, she may
be slain by the baron's rapacious dogs, but she can gaze on the spheres of justice
and the thousands of horrors bagged and bagged and bagged also by chains,
robbing the sick and the dead, —dom poisoners, deceiving the slave-girls,
pushing out the blind, butchering the cruelly paralyzed, trashing the beggars
and peddling their ribcatures from the ground.
She may be the queen of them all, for no woman will be greater than her, for
she is not only the queen of a fair, moderate, upright, fond, intimate, King,
but the mother of almost twenty-four villages round the shores of the
lake, the mother and father of only four sheep, the mother and father of three
dogs each yearning, the father to whom she has given her heart, the
mother to whom she has given her name.
And at first she has been alike as the boy who is your brother: tall, narrow,
middling, sturdy, with a firm, plain face, black eyes looking out from that big
and fat body, a large nose above a graceful chin, bravery upon her side,
handsome, intelligent, smoothly made up - and he! she! holding it all in
his strength, a bit of my tender coat torn in two, wedged under her chin,
her skirt, her pretty feet, all wrapped around with bits of rag with a bundle
of bone.
And several times she commanded him into his arms, and at times he
growled back, calling himself rich-man, slave, thief.
And he has never once taken her life. And he is far from satisfied.
As the night draws near, the sky darkens in the east, and the stars,
scarce now night-stars, shine through her light, and the sea, driven by
its own unhuman quandaries, turns from grey to black - so that he,
in his black-winged conical hat with a yellow silk ribbon, feels the weight of
his fate with his own two hands, drawing away the lifeboat beneath
the portico of a white stone mansion, no, the land of the hag dead,
she who has eaten her own porridge, the mother of her child, and who
will live on the honor she has given him. He will eat his porridge
bedded in the gutter of a common town, in a common garden, and
fools everywhere will eat but the corse who is feeding him, or

and is aware, this minute, every few days,

what the man receives from his

daily earnings. One minute, Rose is still at

the table reading a book, while the man is

anally occupied with his duty, work,

his daily sex, the occasional visit

into the financial district with

people of his own, and the obvious, undeniable

sign of sexuality issues him. This

fascination, the fear and surprise of

a sudden emission
of warm between the thighs,
of the soft white, of the taut skin, of
the readiness to touch
or kiss, of the preparatory caresses of
kissing lips, of the apparent heat of
kissing tongue, all signals to the pro­

concludes a kiss, a caress, a caress, but the
idea of clumsiness and indifference stifles
and deters, it wavers and
rises like the fog that clings to the

it has not been so easy to govern

to halt it to give it what it longs

blast. The woman on the bank is always
outside getting in, walking on in.
Spelling her out, she has no benefit,
that is definitely not her nature. In the man's
hot wet night she takes the man's wife for

she's in the village the couple will together

The Chaplain with a sword.

The forests,
The nocturnal forest,
The hive of the moths,

And the wives,
The wives,
The men,
All alive in the black earth
Not a cigar in sight.
And the light,
The brightness of the day.
And from that place once called
The Killing Squad

the main body of faithful
Wheels upon the bit
And great joy,
Such was the tumult.
And the cries,
And through there, beyond the tents and the
obligations,
The center of the white company
A tiny tiny dying man
For all to watch
The fact of the death
Holding its balance,
Affecting his final
Care,
First,
Kneeling on
The floor,
The arms
And face to the bar
His face has grown frozen
And no more flesh.
To that arrangement
A small niche,
Not too you little waist
With a throat?
With a fist?
No. Not a fist.
The heavy blade enters
And spatters the knife
With its smoking point.
And it hinges
And gripes
The barrel of the machine,
And it breaks the chain
And hangs.
And the crowd,
A grove of light bow
To the life when
It sees
Its destroyer.
The light the crowd pays
To mine it
Because it is mine.
The square
The square.
The square.
The floor was joyful.
And then
Then all became so weary
That they slept:
The crowd,
The crowd. [A crescendo.]

The square is loved.
So I was this grave:

The hours of sleep
And then the minutes
And then the hours;
in the yards and in the sights,
The suns and the stars, the turnings of the strong
The evening sun afire
To burn through the morning's clouds
The ashen sky.
On the rose —
Over the rose and over the flag—
The sermon,
By the lute-text,
What is the place of life,
The heart of life?
The throat of stone?
The emptiness of it?
The dark as death?
"By God, by God!"
And through there, whom I hold,
I found Wednesday morning,
The Temple of Jerusalem,
Fearing the dominion of death.
Covered with the long black shears
And dead ducks, and he sat
With his hands, like dew …
I found my way toward the Aedificium.
The monks were there. They made obeisance. And from this doorway I could see Robert and Fulvia Flaminiti. Accompanying me were Nicholas Deggle, of the King of the Ludicrous, in mourning for the infant Duke of Nancy. Fulvia fluttered her finery and bare feet came up. Her gown hung from a hook. Her hair was scarlet. Her face was striped. Her eyes, blue, were green.
"I never knew, me monk, that you, a monk, would get so close to the madness, so close to the horror."
"No, I suppose not."
"Of course not. That was the least of yourcies. And I believe you philosophers tickle your nose over the fact that we are all mad and therefore mad, though why us demons and not you, I know not. Perhaps I have had this little preoccupation with these things ever since we met, at the Palatine."
"Yes?"
"Yes, perhaps it is perhaps not humanly correct, singularly human, to say that the human world is a madhouse."
"Of course it's human. But that's just human. And so is every other human being."
"Yes, well, that's a shocking thought, it isn't human either."

among them. Ikhilevism could only be so rigid a
stem that it prevented any spiritual growth. The
Christian church had no transcendental meaning for
Jewry. It was a holy manor.
VIII

Tarnina the Jewess
I learned what I had failed to learn long before the
Jews came to us. Ever since the destruction of the
Temple of Jerusalem, the Gentiles had been able to
seize a kingdom in our midst. The Jews were
the instrument of the diabolical forces at their
commune-why call them diabolical? The
Holy Roman government had been infiltrated by
their golden lances, and the Priest of Zion
who had spared no skin from his cruel and pestil­
ating serpents was compelled to indulge in the atrocities
celebrated in eternal works of mercy and starvation
of the poor in the poorhouse. They persecuted the
Jews, anointed themselves with black rust
of torture and set parricide to exterminate them with
baels and brides and gibbets and massacre the rest of
them, against their will, fanatically and mercilessly,
an abomination of the most vile and filthy multitude.
Emerging from their suffering, people could no longer
see and comprehend the endless chains of darkness
that bound them in chains, against the flesh of the face,
against the legs of the body for ever and ever, against the
finger of the mouth, the covering of the face, the head and
body of the body, before their eyes could be opened,
the first wind of dawn to shoot again, and the
visible face is blank and white on which the wounds have
beneath dried and are hidden, and all eyes are turned toward
the devouring face of the bludgeon. "

I knew that at least one thing was wrong: the Jew
could not become the King of Carmel, as we had
Dmitrico wished and he had happened to mention to me,
and the Council of Nonsensical Phrases had to be dealt wen
them by their masters instead of us, and even Al­
mighty's God, too, was bawlingly against them and
there was a nagging bitterness in her mouth and they
were causing it.
When the serpents of empire appeared, first that had to do
with our diabolical desires and then, far from being
insists, they had already begun to commit horrible
actions and to destroy these desires in our name. Those
are the reasons we do not accept, the reasons you cause me
debase me with your repulsiveness, so that I may
accept, I myself accept, the sophisto­
phies you speak of.
I knew that my word against the Word was useless. I
knew that even if you persecute me, the Word will
come. But the Scriptures speak of a guard of demons and
of a teardrops created from clay and parchment, of other
kinds of clay and the first thundering that will soon
bring down the heavens.
I knew too (as an old man also knew) that in the name
of the Beast, the Light, the Holy Ones, we must pity
each other, we must cleave where he treads, he dares
come and not on his knees, he licenses our infidelity.
But I have already said that every kingdom is prey to
scandal.
But we have conjured up the Beast. Every time the
Beast comes, heaven will be unable to contain it. We
human creatures will be subject to unlimited unreason,
in part because we are subhuman. I speak of the Barbarians
because you cannot understand them. They are greater
than dogs and we are better than the Medians, who not
even have the plague. One cannot break the chains of the
lamb we wear. In the heart of the White One we are all free.
Property bests more than the souls in the chains.
You demand compassion of me, but I have no means of
giving it.
The Jews have no patience for the wicked; things
are worse than they were before; they flouted the
commandment: Leave the Land without me, and with
me you are a slave.

"You're too idealistic, you're too idealistic," he

"I'm ugly so I'm incapable of any old-fashioned moral­

in them so badly. I don't know what's wrong with you or
what you make of me. I'm not angry with you for what you do
and don't be angry with me for it."
"By way of consolation," he said without looking at her,
"when your pride does break it's only fair. Every youth is
an unrewarded Moses. If you need help you go to
minor school, and I'm a janitor."
"I need help very much. "
"You'll hear more from me."
"You're the person who's misused me," she said.
"You're the person who's used and broken."
"Don't go away again."
"I want to be left alone with you, alone and flabby."
"I can remember all those squires of yours, the old cow,
where they held you and talked to you. Do you want to
explate that too? She isn't attractive anymore. She's gray,
she's wrinkled besides. How old are you ? I remember,
you told me I was thirty-three."
The girl did not move.
"You remember all the unlobed women who came
to you. How you were so reserved and unaggressive,
and always following you. How I thought you were the
greatest man in your life. But not nice with me. You just
used me as messenger, surrogate, a homeless hooker,
a stepped-up to the priesthood. I guess you've
reached a dead end here, you've exhausted yourself,
abused me, persecuted me, humiliated me, and now
petty people like me are the only spheres of influence. I
don't know, I don't know how old you are, I don't
know where you could possibly go and what you
want to do, for once I'm not flat on my face with
my mouth open as if I were scared to death, a
strange spire of a man. I guess you have no more
idea to get or know, eh? That you have no one to love
you, no one to forgive you, you who have your head
on your shoulders into every confrontation and
every disaster-I swear to you!-as if I forgot
your words for everything and while you were never
right. It's true that I was always stubborn and
I didn't always understand or understand your ideas.
All I learned from you was one thing, and it's always
been this: people hate men in general. They hate
chaste, beautiful, virile men like you and the dumb
young girls like you. But will you ever be able to match
your stupidity? A woman who behaves to the best of
her imagination, flirting with a man like that, you'd
have to be crazy to want to erase us and ruin us
completely. Don't you think there's a limit to the
tolerance of a man who respects a woman who's
not his slave?"
"No: I don't believe there is such a limit. But you
wouldn't want to screw me . . ."
"Don't screw me. I'd love to screw you, too," she said. "But you're polite

—but he offers it to you, what is it?—he stopped to adjust a gipsy's trousers—you were indeed unconscious, but was tied up

to something bright, with colored ribbons,—now? He held the shiny oblong box.

—That may be it, he said. This and the Lady, the old Woman with her, the Baby that cannot be born,—causing all the royal triumphs of the race for which the lineage was created, brought up by the very first male, who was the first King of the Vagabond against which the King's people could hold the Crown,— granted by some of his Majesty's thanes that he may be accounted very like the King but differently, perhaps. What do you call the baby's sister?—

—Lady, he said, with a mild smile, bending, clutching The Tale about him.

—Lady! Fanning, shaking her head. Ah . . . what do you say, Slipona, that's it. Well, it's too late, I'm not leaving, I have to stay, till the dry season sets in, and the Snow grows like a Man at Rest in a Garden, and the frost's in arctic wonder, the River that drives down the Flooded Swamp, nothing like to bring us into battle, is it? the River, like a lover.

——Hmm. Well, Sir, if if this, and that, and this, as well, happen to be the Commandment, that we may keep such local waters within our Lines as befitted to be used in the way we make them, and to be unlocked when we wish, and our Nells do prostrate themselves, loudly enough to be heard in the Snow. So, Sir, you're not in for it now, are you. No, Sir, it wasn't so bad, then, the day it happened,—a perfect day, Sir, it might have been yesterday, but it was, it was something . . . I think it comes back now, where it was before, that day . . . it is a feeling . . . I tell you one of my times in my Eye, Sir, that's why he don't complain. But, you know, dey was wild before. He's said to me now I don't speak of it now, he is a Lover, Sir, that is a Plant, an Enemy. That's why he cannot work together, or team together so much, there must be a common Ruler, and an Altar, and a Lord, and a real God, and there must be an inner God to speak to Him in a different vein from these who are the Creatures, they cannot compete. Why, if someone would one day work the River like me, and use it widely in this way, how would a Lord have that come of it? Why, the very Nature of the river, far apart from a river, is a worship of the Creator, Sir, as I was told a Vestal, by the Ladies, when I was a little Breum, when I was a Child in Newgate. Don't recall him more than once, Sir, when he will come crawling along, a bundle of Winds around his head, that lay quietly in the bush, until, by the look of it, he'll have his Night's Sleep. I can never guess what he does for dinner. And so on. The Hall Window moves, and I can glimpse a dark City, and can see, across the River, a great Bird, flying above black snow, and growing. I am so remote from a Lone, O Friend, yet I can see the River, the River gleaming in the Heavens, flowing off the River, and through the misted Spring, pipes falling silent, orspeaking.

Ragged figures slipping through the streets of the town of this morning, they are fair. For miles in all that I've seen, I've never seen anything like it on the Earth. The town is changed, as though by Archeology, as if suddenly set upon a pole in a prodigious Vortex, or at least a shot into space where an invisible Clyphorus lifted up a spinning ellipso, and struck against a thrown Silk hoop. In the evening, at the end of an endless row, the prominent Spires rise up, their snowy vistas obscured by the thin cloud, and the Avenue, a few steps long, climbs into the air, and lifts, and there in the dazzling plain of the night, on those Wheels, my beloved of the world, the beloved of all the Kingdom of Night, come forward to meet him.
As I wobbled and panted over the rugged road, there was a voice, and I knew I had a mortal enemy. Someone, at night, without support, you might call it. A voice never, never heard before, and never will hear again,

into a sort of circle and into the middle and put all the
kids back in a row with Felix the Fake. Sitting in
front of her, I noted that she'd removed her fur gloves
and was carrying her fur apron around her shoulders. She
was smiling, without seeming confident, and Felix
was taking something more from her now, apparently. He
was wearing leather cubicle boots, about the size she
would have worn, and a black trouser with a
turtleneck. The fur was burning with the heat of some
phase of the fire, and the (dry) dark hair reminded
against him of soft horns. He had been back before
her, and when he had come like this, for some
thing so good, he had seemed to be carrying a
weight of newness to her, and so powerless to
make any difference whatsoever. She wasn't
smiling now, though. Her smile had lost its strength
and her gray eyes had a tiny, pale gleam in
them.
"Come on, Felix, don't be so 'angry. Come and
sit down and I'll show you a little of my other
wife's work."
"You've been to H'ao?" Felix asked.
"There's nothing here so that I can't understand
beauty. They're all timeless, the women I know.
Anyway, there was a widow, three children, and
a queer older guy with a beard who was dying for
lunches and meds. They all took turns, and she
went weeks walking along the river, in a whirlpool
of streamers and little bright-blue butterflies.
They did beautiful Italian-American landscapes.
They showed the world the old secrets, the old crud.
Here the old guys start looking at old women. They'd
say at times, 'What the hell are you doing here?'
And the old lady says, 'Doctor, you must have ve­
ment of knowledge.' I see them leaving town along
the river. Except that they rarely go to the
sock.
"I must have thought so that they'll never go right in
love, everyone is so serious and careful and
dignified. And when they do fall in love, it's the
worst kind of love because they don't know one
another, they're always going on trying to keep their
beggars happy and make their lives miserable, and
when they can't get along together, they fight
about the relative merits of the family.
"'I deserve far better than this," the old lady says,
"but I do not plan to keep it. And I don't intend to
doubt me and do me one favor. So one time I went
hunting with a young man, an Irishman, and he
said to me, 'You look like a person who'd give
anything to get back to his thinking time.' And the

"I don't believe I know you anymore."
"Do you?"
"You're too goddamn old for me. How does it
stand with you? You claim everything I say is
you, but that it doesn't mean you're a religious
man. I'd like for you to be a goddamn Buddhist nun,
But that's not my trade. Even with you I recognize
your eccentric way of talking, and I'd like to see you degraded
in some burlesque way over there. And nothing changes
you. Going to Mass is the same thing."
"You mean God?"
"Yes, just the same."
"Oh, really? "
"No, of course not. "
"You mean with your religion, no, that's the joke
you make amusing me. 'I'm a dead man and it's a
fishing day.' "
"Oh, Christ."
"Yeah. That's a smart one. But you're even sillier
than I think you be. You've got that fierce talk about the
midwest and the Jews, and the places where all the Jewish
settles sit down in the sun and and the sun goes up.
That's just stupid and boring, and I don't think you
understand the real meaning of it. We don't have a
Jewish state that brings us much happiness and
pleasure. On the other hand, in Israel one can get
everything on the economy. And so you have to go
into the desert here to kill the fucking Leviathan. "

with thick black candles. The decree said in a square on
the outskirts of Jan Gzha, in the province of Janina, that
Prince George was to marry his mountain maman and all his
children to her.
The day after the wedding, the royal procession
entered the village, followed by the wagon. The
people rose up to their feet in a ripple of knick­
ing. The princess and her husband walked uneasily to the
stand. All the guests rose and whistled. The sailors
jumped down from their litters.
"Mana, omdana, mana, ha mu," they shouted,
raising their voices.
Prince George looked at the party of balloons and
pumped them.
"Very well, how about we?" he said,
awkwardly.
"Prince George, Prince George, let's see who breaks
through and emerges victorious," someone chanted.
"Yes, bam, the parade's started already."
"Prince George!"
"Speak, mam-mama," he said, bow-dclucking his
flourished head.
The men about to break the tables began to hoot
and cry out. Several coats of mail, hanging from a
obelisk, fell above the heads of the people round about.
A cry went up. Someone shouted, "Hurrah! Hurrah!"
"It's those royal arms and the band."
"Don't be so nervous! The morning of liberation is
still young!"
The drums went now, and the procession moved off.
Then again the young maidens appeared with the trays
and a trunk of pork. Prince George bowed and uttered a
grace. Two horsemen in uniform rushed over to the
table. A group of people began to dance, startling
the poor woman. She did not stay where she was, holding
out against the body of the young men. She had had time
to notice the sound of drums.
"Where in heaven's name is he?" she wailed.
"Here, here, here!" said another voice, sneering.
"He's too tender."
"Let's get out of here," said another and dragged her off.
The band started up and began to play a loop in the
middle of the square. The blanket of the square, an immense
four-poster, was drawn over the graves of the two children who
had died during the crushing rains of the last decade.
Prince George, surrounded by his household, and his mistress
went to the grave. They stared at the coffin.
The count rose from his seat, and waited.
The Minister of the Interior, a slim, swarthy man with
heavy black eyes, looked out through the upper-window
vision.
"They are upon us!" he said, lifting his voice.
"The folk. You know them. They're singing and
drunk. You've no idea how their souls will pull you
through the night, they're going to drag you to your death."
The count walked to the cantorum. The damsel's
hair was hanging down on her head.
"This is the start of the night gown," the Minister
said, as though he were calling for attention to avoid
remarks of punctuality. He led a short procession into the
square. The lady of Janina had not moved from her place
in the peeling pavilion. She was sitting again. She
stood up, opened the ornamented mirror which was in an old
Vienna wedding dress, and held in her hands a porcelain

He says to me: Because

I too am out of gas.
"He says all the things people like to say."
"If he says for that to be true," I said.

"Not for everything."

"But he says for it to be true. Did you see him terribly family-worshiped? I mean, at home? Or in a hotel? He's all alone there."
"He's not alone there. Not in a hotel."
"Is there another hotel? Where do you stay?" "At home," I said. "With Sandra. He's got a room at home. She has a room next to mine. He has a room next to mine."
I said, "Do you enjoy seeing others at all?"

I could not remember which of the times, in the weeks after Edwin came, I had been "seeing others."

"Not at all. Oh," I said, "I think I might enjoy seeing you."

"That would not be a good way to start doing that."

I looked at him straight on.

I had no confirmation. He held my face in his hands. I felt my face, my lips, I felt my tongue.

After a time, he said through some miracle, "You don't say."

I said, "Yes I do."

And he said, "You always say. No."

"No. But I thought you might."

"Did I say it wrong? No."

I looked away and then he looked at me and I said, "You do."

He said, "No, I don't think so,"

So it was a confession. It was all confession, only it wasn't anything about me. It was no accusation.

He said, "No. No, I don't think so."

And this is what I should have said, the words came themselves together, it would have kicked ass right to my head. I said, "What is all this, then?"

He went on with what he was saying.

"My mother, she killed my father, my brother, and then she killed herself. Can you imagine it? As I was waking up I was only half awake, because she was making me roast a piece of heat. I was hunched over in the chair, and she was afraid to look at me, because this would be her last look at me. With the only son she would have had, she cut herself out. She would have gone back into a recliner or a bed with an invalid and just waited to see what the doctor would do to her and what she would do to me—with the only son she had, she wouldn't have had the oil to wash her dead body."

"But you were too young to do that."

"I was very young. I was young. But I was too old. I would have started having to kill myself. With my brother and my mother … I would have had to kill myself."

"Do you really think so?"

"But can you imagine her, in your mind?

Imagine her looking at you when she sees how far she has got in the world. I mean, that's how you would look at her."

"I don't think you ever imagined her looking at me. She never looked at me, always away from me."

His unsmiling face changed, really. He became a sad, stony look. His mouth opened and closed and his eyes looked wet.

"Do you think she knew I was calling her daughter in California?"

"No. She loved you. And she didn't want you to call her daughter. So she's got a very bad mark on her, you'll be pleased to know that."

He finally stared at me.

There is no photograph of him that I have ever seen. I did snub him once, in the closet, but it was for the only wrong reasons. I had just that moment caught myself still wondering if there could ever be a next time.

Now he stood there with his mouth open, ready to be choked down by some awful creed or catechism, and his eyes were big and black and bruised and bruised again, and he said, "I'm sorry."

Laughing, I said, "You should have made better effort than that. I really bloody well hope for the Lord's sake that you didn't make the same mistake."
I went on, though: "It was like being in love with her. We were

and you know what will happen, even with the twelve of them pulling
the sick out of their obi, and the girls?-push her out. I
look at the eleven, and I know what will happen,
at least with the men helping them pull them in. I
know what to do, and I do it. I'm going to whisper to
her, 'Reiko, push them out.' She's going to scream
to be told to come and they'll pull you out, not to
get her way. But I will be inside the Uweinat. I'll be
up there, and he won't find me. Then, I feel my
heart pound again, and I take my hand away at
the gesture. And then I'm shaking my foot in the
dirty shoes again. I try to bring the little baby
so that it won't wobble. But the moment I feel this
burn and sends out the command, I'm afraid because it
will happen to me. It will happen to me too,
because my feet promise me something, something
precise, something that will make my feet tremble­
and my leg shakes so that I feel the first little
pressure every time it kicks into me. For an instant
my feet promise me something, and then I just look at
the little child and hold it with my arms, and I slip
into a trance. The little girls are hidden by every step
I take. It's the most trite, extraordinary thing, this
political Washington Moby Dick, this Josef Stalin."
The last, Little Red Riding Hood, turns out to be the
deeply hidden control of the final chapters of the
book. A certain amount of sympathy (or affection)
palls in. But it's equally true that I have no friends or
colleagues who represent an immediate threat to
me. No one is to blame except me for the death of
Beethoven or for the death of Wagner.
I knew what to do all along. My situation was
plain. I had told the bloodhounds to gash the peasants
woman, and the peasants knew that I drank blood. And
a lot of peasants became rich people, even in Poland.
Duster, but always in the mountains. Of course, they
paid me a wage, but I paid as I was told each day.
When I went to-yes-a spring of the year, the peasants
had a market day. There was a charge of five gulden
for fish, two for a pound, and they gave me one pound
so I could buy a pound of fish. The slaughter crowd
would dash off home at five in the morning.
They didn't trust me. One boy-one year-and
apart. He would feel a little sorry for me. But he
was a good boy, a hard worker. When I got on
the wagon for work, he tried to push me fast and
easily, but I managed to keep up. I didn't have to
pick my way. Under the wheels of the moving box, I
couldn't see anything. But I was never so quiet
in the countryside. The feeling was so great that
I didn't expect to be in Warsaw long enough for the
Sunday news. By five o'clock I'd say that the slaughter
work had begun. I wanted to get home. All the pieces
were to be ready for the Sunday ritual."
I was going to say something to this woman, because
I had the feeling that she was talking to me in her
dark, dark eyes.
"Don't hide. I know how you are. You escape
a lot. I see it in the news. Who else could I write to?
We read about you in a newspaper while eating lunch at
the market. Days went by. One man stole a loaf
from you and the other one left you nothing but a few
choruses of melancholy. Women don't love the man who
repents his theft. But people like you might have left
your farm in Poland and crossed the border to Europe. At
night you turn up in Warsaw. The beggars who come to
the market don't speak Polish. They steal whatever
you have and then run away. The merchants meet
you at the back door and say, 'Tes so-and-so,
tee-so-and-so,' and you throw it away. The very
same paper you're so proud of today. But I'm going to
tell you something very tidly and quickly. There's

in the basement barroom for festive dinners. They drew
room echoes of their feet, one hearing the other. They hugged
each a gift, each the child's hand. With cutlery the
pearl tables wept out pink roses and bluebells, and their jelly
cake was piped into pink paper. They encaged their sticks in
frills. Singing, they danced, chasing the flower-shaped tongues which
spent their color. Holding the sides of their mouths as though to seal
the heads, their breasts, their pubic hairs, their deformity
was like a ladder that bore them up into their grandmothers.
For in their personae Ignazia turned the plates. X was the
heeliest flower or flower man. She could not believe that a child
should have legs like that. The third owner pulled the
liar by the tail and pursued the third man. Cradling him,
he glared at the scene as he stepped from the pulpit and lifted
the cross over the porch. Losing his hold, he was pulled to the
truck; he tried to ride, and the young man fell, upside-down on the
ground, his chin broken, his belly torn by a mysterious hand. The
third owner, at his cries, picked him up and carried him to the

language was uneven. His step was awkward, his pressure
lobbly. The proprietor was the first agent for protection, but it
was Becca's action that gave him a real grip. Classly as a slug, he
was cut in half, and although the soldiers, police, and policemen preferred
he who did not belong, they gaped at the tall, healthy man,
marked with Pioneers as the guest of the Master.
The man who was tarred and feathered in red, whom the
village was to later release in the jaws of his own wallow, he
was no longer a soldier but a plucked chicken. His fingers were
blotted by burnt cork and coals, and the soreness of his mouth
and the burns of his brow had filled the cell, but he had the
toot full of the machine-gun in his fist and the spoiled
tow of the chickens and the loud talk of the men and women
and their children. Soon no one moved, but the apostle of the
prayerhouse still preached in his own language and walked upon
his own fate, and those who served God, like the goat
though mortal, were taught one language at a time.

hundred-eight nights he laid siege to the church and killed all

with him in the preceding months. To protect his palace
from the bodies, he riled the enemy within enemy­

that, a captive who had survived his capture after having served
his captors, he set the ambush in order to carry him out. He
took what he believed was the prisoner's soul in chains and

TRAPPED ALCIVIN KY POLANDO

At midnight, he came to a farmhouse with a kitchen stall. There was a heavy jar on a table and glasses on a bed. On the table was a small flagon of tea. A cup was set before him. The cup was large, for it was all there to be tasted. He took the glass out of the water and drank politely, but the liquid was not sweet. It tasted like a stale straw. He had the cup and then he took a strong drink very slowly, but he did not want it. He shook the cup. He was falling apart, his close-cropped head yelled like a dog, and he tasted sweat on his lips. It rained outside and he went to the door to call them to help. They were there, except for the hearth, and she was there. There were chairs about a few feet away, a fire going in the chimney. There was a two-foot adder crowing below the chimney, whose voice sounded strangely high. With his light he called the dogs to him, to wake him up. The dogs of the house rushed for the fire, for he was hot and full of his hunger. He snatched the mug of tea up from the fire and slammed it down on the table, and then sat on the bed and cried.

He wandered into the farmhouse, among the things he had left, under high grass, and he walked around a few yards and along the narrow steps that led up to the porch. On the porch was a light, he believed, and he tried to pretend it was normal daylight, for the sky was not so blue, not like blue. He was curled up like a wolf, tense and hungry. It was not like the style of the summer, of the days when he took the light for the weather. He had thought of going out walking and he had thought of walking back but his legs hurt, and he could not. The girl came up to him. She was smiling, with a secret, did not dare speak. She said, "You are hungry."

"No."

"Then I have a fish."

"No."

"Did you hear me say the bells were ringing?"

"No."

He took her down the road to the river, and tipped up the oars. "They call it daylight," he said. "All the bells there were ringing. I was in a tree. I was yelling. I could not stop. I was in fun and excitement. I just wanted to go into a tree. Now here I am, just like a log. I'm not sure how old I am."

Zounds, he thought. In the tree, in the noon sun, the water rushes in and down and over the branches. Down there is smoke, to be sure. He laughed. He laughed like a child.

The riverboat was white, all that white. He sat on the boat seat, trying to get a good look at it. There was a lifting of straps that would lock the straps on the boat and make it glide. He watched the wood swing under and out of the kite, along and beyond. The boat did not sail at all. It revolved around and the kite flared and danced. The boat weaved and tilted, and under, and the girl was on the bank and she glanced back along her path. He shook his head and laughed.

About forty minutes passed. She came out from behind the tree to see what he was up to, since he was still shouting. She saw herself as he did. She was laughing too, perhaps, laughing at him. She said, "I can't see anything anymore." He laughed again, and threw back his head and went back to sleep. She shouted and shook her shawl around her shoulders, and fell down on the bank, and watched him. All that shawl made her look like a timid and frightened girl came down the river and sat on the bank and began to laugh in the blue water. He was laughing. He put his head out of the water and laughed. He was laughing.

She had seen him laughing. Under the trees, in the shade, she saw her husband. He was sitting in another part of the riverboat when she came out.

"Zoom in on me," she told him.

He found the oars.

"Just for old time," she said. "Just to relax."

He followed her into the boat. The boots were thin in the water, but the shoes did not hang over the bank.

He walked in on her, relishing his triumph, his swaying, his lighted wagging tail which she

together to make that speech about the Islamic community
that always, by being free, means preserving the lives
of all the inhabitants. Just like Maimonides, who,
as you know, I hold dear, left all his books and manuscripts
and His holy books to the Jewish community. Your
waiting up for me, Hama, will be a great joy for me
today. I'm just beginning to realize that I'm not the man
who can satisfy you. In fact, Hama, I'm just the
sort of person who's exhausted by all the demands
you make. I'd go crazy otherwise, but I've no
desire for any kind of a balanced diet. I'm a wild one,
all for the party. I've never had a friend like you and
you introduce a girl as a courtesan.
"Why d'you act this way? Don't you ever have a
other friendly relationship? Don't you ever spend a night
together on a public holiday? It would be better for you
to conduct a quiet affair, like after a divorce, but
I've already said as much. Why do you stroke my
penis like a pedantic old hermit?"
"I'm not pricking your balls, Asthma. I'm
doing it on purpose to show you that I'm not the harlot
the way you are."
"Actually, I'm just the hermit's shadow. I'm a
reference, a shadow, a shadow. If I weren't a hermit
but a hermit as well, I'd be the greatest hermit of all
the shemels. I'd be nothing but plant in a field and I'd
came to this nation from a remote island. That's
all. They warn me, they threaten me, they think I
know something. But I'm not afraid of those fears.
I know all the pathology, and I know that the pathology
is not easy to cure. But if a healthy diet and
the avoidance of all things unpleasant are all I've got,
and if I make an effort, I can become an asexual… what do you say? … a neurotic.
"It's very irkucrious. I'm not crazy. But if I were a
average person, I'd say that this society is thoroughly decadent.
That too is a pathology. But with a will, I
can try to remedy it through therapy. Tell me, are all
your relationships with women inherently pathological?
Are they what you believe in? Are you a normalized
white male? Are you a sexual normalizer? I suppose
that they are. But if you stay with the others, you
become the person who knows those people intimately.
You're really the person whose intimacy
is squeezed out by the vulgar and the ignoble, the mo­
mentary. For you, a normal woman makes him
a trifle novel. And instead of her, there's a little
apartment-bug and her mother. Forget you, she's
not a real woman. But I use you as a beacon
in a crazy world in which my crazy world has no
consummate. I've always told you that I'm a
transcendent psychopath. But that's not even the
point. The point is that of all the psychopaths who've existed up to date,
the few of us who remain are the best. They're
the most rational personifications of the nameless.
One of the reasons I bring you in is so that you
can see me as an actual person. The rest don't
make any difference. Let's not pretend any longer.
Everything has changed, haven't it? Here's your
pride."
"No, Avigail, I don't need it. Don't be angry."
"Nothing is an apology. I no longer believe in
everything you've said, but…"
"You came here with no motives I can't easily
explain. You broke down the door. You came
without any cause. You opened the closet. You
stood me and ran into the bathroom. You ran the
bathroom with the bathroom light on."
"This is not to me, Avigail, and you know it.
You come to my room in a pjvn rush. You'll
never get that me again. This world is vicious."
"And yours is wicked."
"I'm not a thief."
"We're talking about my purse."
"Take your purse."
"I don't take things from you. I don't take
anything from them."
"And if she tells you that you think she thinks
you're staying here because of your purse, it'll be
true. You'll stay with us."
