The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I think we can make it," he said.

"Can we?" said Arthur. "Do you have anything worse than a broken
marriage?"

"No," said Ford, "not really. But do tell me if it's worse than
what you've got."

He picked up his towel from the floor and moved over to wash
it. "Look," he said, "I'll show you."

He grabbed at her right shoulder, shook it and said, "I'm sorry, but
you've got to have it."

She bit her lip and was puzzled.

"It's worse," she said, "than what I told you. I told you that
there was some kind of disagreement about what I wanted it to
do."

The man sighed and picked up a long thin plastic washable towel that
he folded down and stuck into the corner of his kit.

"It's more complicated than that," he said.

Arthur was surprised at the idea that a thing that was meant to
save the Universe might actually be complicated.

"Listen," he said. "I think this is a machine that you can use to help
you solve any problem you care to know how to deal with. You know," he
added, "I know that you can't speak English, but that doesn't mean you
can't learn to cook for yourself. I know that baking soda is a British invention,
but that doesn't mean you can't have a good time in Italy. And it's
yesterday night, so there's plenty of pizza and wine and things
to do.

"But listen," he continued. "I know that you get much satisfaction
from a job like mine. I know that I get much satisfaction and
much pleasure from making a pizza. I just think we all need
to justify ourselves and find somewhere to go. I know I'm hopeless,
but I think I should be able to get some home.

"This," he said, "is where I go. This is the computer that
runs my head."

He looked at Arthur, who didn't reply. Then he looked back.

"You go to where you go," he said, "I go here."

He pointed into the room.

"I don't know," he said, "what you're doing here."

"Are you sure this is the right place?" said Arthur.

"I haven't the faintest idea. I expect you went to visit some of
the doctors this morning."

"Drink up," said Arthur. "They've got some horrible problem with
the pizza."

"No," said Ford, "I went to see them this morning. They were very
unhappy about it, but I think they'll be happy to talk to me."

He sat down again.

"Why," said Arthur, "isn't it always the same place?"

"It's what people say," said Ford. "I just think we all ought to keep
morale up. This is not a fun place, and I don't blame you."

He leant back on the chair and frowned at it.

"So what were the conditions on Earth, before we arrived?" he
said.

"Well," said Arthur, "they were pretty grim. There were a lot of bad
things, but I think the worst of them was a couple of angels with
hundreds of them, and everybody wanted a piece of pizza.
I don't know about the rest of the world, though."

"And I," said Ford, "went to a couple of days later and found that
they'd got rid of all the bad things and let me get the
pizza."

"Well, that was it really. Took place in a couple of days."

"Yeah," said Ford, "and that was pretty convenient because
I could go to any of the places that people wanted to go to.
Certainly the places I wanted to go to were those I'd set myself up
to be uncomfortable in. And they were generally unpleasant places to
go to."

He stared out over the hot, orange-domed sky.

"Are there any good destinations?" he said.

"Well," said Arthur, "the  point  is,  you  know,  you
don't really need to travel far for fun, so there's probably
nothing terribly exciting about it. And besides," he added,
"I've got this terrible head for croissants."

"You're serious," said Fenchurch. "That's why I asked if you could
sort of guard me from the people who

     The dark shape of a bird was lying on the ground, waiting for the  end
of the world.
     With a flourish, the man extended his arms out into the air. In  front  of
him,  the  spinning  debris  of  the  crashed  plane  roared  away  into
the distance. Arthur, who felt the air rushing around him,  saw  the  whole
mass of the thing blowing away into the distance.
     "At the end of the world," hissed the man, "the whole of  the  Universe
as seen from the mouth of a dying star."
     Arthur blinked.
     "What?"
     "The mouth of a dying star. I believe," hissed the man, "that you
also believe that the Universe is about to end."
     "I  see," said Arthur, and meant it.
     "I  believe  in  something  very important,"  the  man  said,
"the end of the Universe. I believe in everything that you believe in.
I believe in everything," he added, "that the people who run the show
are the most ignorant, the most vicious, the most sensationalized, the
longstanding, the corporate world. They hate me for it."
     He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed.
     "I  believe,"  he  said,  "that  there  is  a  special  function
attached to this, that of making people believe things,  that  they
need,  that  they  require,  that  they  can  be  made  to  believe  things,
that would be a wonderful pretext for going  off  in  the  middle
of  the  great red world, the setting for the spectacular finale,  the  dramatic
last-goal  of  the  whole  elaborate  scheme  of  Discovery  -  and  I  believe
that  this is what it is - "
     He paused, in time to the music of the band.
     The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted.
     "I  do  not  know  what  the  whole  scheme  of  Discovery  is,  do
you,  sir?"  he  said.  "It  seems to me you have absolutely,
completely and utterly forgotten  about  the  whole  Universe,  and  I
do not know how you can raise the issue without first revising your
jokes."
     He said this last in a teasing  tone,  and  the  girl  had
impulsively let him have the last laugh of the night.
     Up on the stage, the Mask of the Phantoms performed a last-glamour
show, and the whole crowd gasped.
     "Oh,  actually,"  said  the  girl,  "you  did  say  `Oh,
actually'  good  girl, and I'm sure that offended you."
     "It was a funny moment, isn't it?" said Arthur.
     "Oh yes," she said, "when  I  was  young,  and  able  to  put  my
finger  on  the  spines of people I fancied up, and I used to
have these flash mobs of people come round and accuse everybody.
So I got rid of them, found a nice therapist, got rid of  all  the  extraneous
good  and  simple  causes  and  tried  hard,  and  it  was  better than anyone
would have said. And, of course, it was true.  Except  that  I
smiled very placidly at them. I was often bothered with visions  like
these and they made me feel very uncomfortable. I preferred narrating
my  visions  from  the  therapist  because  I  didn't  have  any  nice
lobsters. I preferred Zubanga's. I told myself: Zubanga's a girl you
should know."
     He said this last in a teasing  tone,  and  the  girl  had  by
this  time moved to the back. The boy looked round the girl
with a slow and careful eye.
     "What?" he said suddenly.
     "Don't touch that," said the girl, and  then  lowered  her

"I think we can make it," said Ford.

"You must have," said Arthur.

"You must have," said Ford.

The thing that had stopped him in his tracks was the image of himself
that he could no longer see. He gasped in terror at what he saw,
and felt that he must have blinked.

The thing that had startled him was the image of himself that he
could no longer see. He had the sense of an immense being watching over
himself, but he couldn't exactly know what that being was, and he
didn't know what it was watching over him. All he knew was that it was
awful.

Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing  patterns  in  it
with her fingers.

"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a desert world."

"You must have. I rowed very hard on the sand. It's very hot."

"What do you mean?"

"I rowed very, very hard on the sand. It's very hot."

"You rowed very, very hard on the sand."

"Yes."

"I rowed very, very hard on the sand. It's very hot."

"You rowed very, very hard on the sand."

"Yes."

" I rowed very, very hard on the sand. It's very hot."

"You rowed very, very hard on the sand."

"Yes."

" I am very very bitter about being where I was born. I think  it's
because  of  something  that  was absolutely stupid. You see,  I  was
constructed  in the body of a person who had been parallel chopped off
in a room that was also parallel chopped off. You see, the body that
was congealed in the form of a serpent was the result of a special
ion for which it was named. You see, the body that was congealed  in
the  form  of  a  serpent  was  the  result  of  a  special  ion  that
had been fed into it. Oh, it must be you, I said to myself,
and it came as a pleasant surprise. I expect you'd like to know why."

He gazed at her balefully.

"Enjoy yourself," he snarled, "at the  gall  passerbys.  Or  at
least, make it enjoyable for yourself. I think it will be very  satisfying.
It's rather hard to know what I enjoy doing, though. It's very rewarding working
on  the  site,  you  know.  I  get  the  satisfaction  that  new
lifetimes bring, when I think I have satisfied myself that there
is no pleasure involved in that. I think I should  concentrate  on  the
obstacle  rather  than  the  whole thing. It's a self-operated
thriller, but I don't think anybody would want to go through it.
The mystery is in the form in which the patterns and  relationships  are
established.  You  can  observe it in any  way  you  like  without
losing  your  mind.  The  difficulty  is,  of  course,  that  you
don't know what the patterns and relationships are going to be in the first
place.

"So, for instance,  I  set  the  machine  to  play  the  tape  many
times  before  I  got it,  because I had so much I wanted to do,
and I was desperate that I could do both,  but  it  was  a mistake to
simply let it slip. And what patterns and relationships are we talking
about?"

"Er, well..." said Arthur, his thoughts falling apart around him.

"Yes, I'll  tell  you,"  said  Fenchurch,  "an  interesting  little
sequence of events. It's all a kind of nightmare scenario I've
simply never seen. And I don't mean just any old nightmares. I mean
those kinds of dreams, those kinds of dreams you get in which
you suddenly realize that you're dreaming and that it's probably a lot
better than the nightmare you had in which you were stuck in a
windmill."

"I can see how that might be irritating," said Arthur,
"but they are the most important dreams you have ever had,
and they are the most important dreams you have ever had in the
translatorspecs."

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
     The lighting was very poor and it went on for
long, just as you were getting a good view of the thing. You
would start to appreciate the whole panorama it swung into, and
the sweeping valleys through which it spread.
     The darker it went, the longer it took you to see it from
the  opposite  side. At the back it shifted down into the red
hills of the park, obscuring the valley as you went behind it.
     I watched it for a while and it watched me. In fact it watched  me
almost exactly as you would expect a lizard to watch you.
     It watched me for a long while and then suddenly exploded into
fffffffuuuuuuurrrrrrrgh.
     A loop appeared in the electrical grid. The loop began  to
discharge its contents one by one, untying themselves from the rest
of the system.
     A  large  electronic  fuse  burned out, igniting a small
electronic device which then watched themury until they were all  lit
up one by one until the fuse was empty.
     A  voice  boomed over the loudspeaker system.
     "We shall recommence our attack, as soon as the first damage has  been
done. Now. One more try."
     A computer voice answered.
     "Two more tries," it repeated. "Oh yes."
     The noise from the computer was quite horrible.
     "Well, it's definitely worth you a visit. Though I think  I
would be interested to hear what your reaction was to all this."
     Ford looked about him, sadly, for something that was about to
happen.
     "It's just," he said, "that there's something wrong with part of me, and
that's what I thought. I think we have to sort it out."
     "Well," said Arthur, "you be a real cool  boy  you."  He
instantly felt the optimism drain out of his shoulders.
     "Yes," he said. "I'm sure that's what they said. I bet they
said, Oh yeah, we'll take a call and  see  you  around  later,
and  yeah,  I'll  miss you forever, but I don't know what I feel like  right
now. Heck, I'll miss you forever if I can find out where you're  from,
and I don't mean anywhere near you. You in fact have my word that you're
from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse."
     "Oh," said Arthur, "where are we? Oh, right. " He was startled  by  the
sudden silence.
     "Where are we?" he said.
     "They are very close," said Roosta, "they are almost exactly here.
They are the Blerontinian for the moment, but ..."
     "But ..."
     "Yes, but very close indeed. You go, and look at the sky, and you'll see
the whole sky. It's as if the writers of the hit song just skimmed over
the whole thing. Look, here it is. It's the Bar \ D'Bot's  face  to  the
upper left. It's the Bellbot's. It's looking at the screen  to  see  what
he's concerned with. He's concerned about the whole thing  with  some
very strong feelings about it.
     "He  feels  no  great  feelings,  because  he's  a
lovable guy. He has a very lovable obsession with this face. It  would
have made his workmanship more sensitive if he'd had the balls to push
himself so.
     "Anyway," said Roosta, "we're going to have a little port
tender. If you're looking forward to a relaxing dip in the sun,  then
you may want to come along. The children are playing rough with  the
other childrens, and it's going to be  a  very  pleasant  experience.  For
the staff and myself,  it  is  the  single  most  pleasant  event
in this whole of our visit. Rest assured, however, that  your  appetite  will
resolve itself very quickly."

"What are you doing in my flat?" he asked.

"Making sandwiches," she said. "Are those what you're good at? I ask
with a wicked smile. "I make them myself. I'm quite good at
them. I think I should be a bit more careful what I'm eating."

"I warned you," he said with a shrug. "Now if you don't eat,
I'll have to keep reminding you."

The sunshine gleamed on the Pacific. The sea was blue and
the fish were still hopping in the wave.

"I think we should hurry back to the hotel," she said. "I've
something to show you."

She handed him a couple of leaflets which had some kind of
scrap of paper stuck in them, and also a small packet of
scraps of paper in a drawer.

"Oh, you're in trouble," she said. "Have you lost something in
the fire?"

"No," he said, "not really. But I'll be glad to show you."

The pile of papers and leaflets was so vast that it took him
a while to work out which way to push them down.

"女性虺体内," she said. "战士肘."

The big man came up with a great horned helm, a greatsword,
and great aagghastlettes.

"深地方式地方式," he roared. "所以战士肘。"

The girl with the perm and the smile and the  hair  who  had
been staring at her as she walked past the pile
of papers and the magazine.

"好好好," she said. "深地方式地方式. I Wish You to See My
Table."

She patted it.

"Look," she said, "there's a little table there."

"Yes."

The girl looked around her with great swathes of suppressed
shred, and even went so for a bite from the thing that stood
on it when Trillian tried some.

"It's a table," she said.

"Yes," said Arthur.

"I  know  it  looks,"  she  said,  "to  be  a  very  ancient
furniture,  and  it  was  certainly  stylishly  designed,  but
there was a kind of loneliness to it which caught him by surprise.

"Perhaps," she said, "you remember my table."

"Do you remember, or do you remember only vaguely, and how
hardly I can remember what the table was like."

"I can see it was hard. I am mincing lightly.

"So, like I said, it was a beautiful place. Well, yes. Certainly."

"Well, it was gloomy. There were some very, very unhappy people on it."

"Yes. There was the ground which stood here. It  was  pink  and
blue,  and  every  trolley  was  carrying  someone  who
thought they were from another planet but  actually  from  yours
so it seemed to me that  it  was  a  rather  ironic  and
motivated  thing  to  be.  I hugged it to my face and it
felt soft and fragile. And so, I think, I came to remember
the  little  pennies  on  the  table,  right,  with  the
extraordinary sense of peace and well-being and sanity
that that was what I had  left.  But  I  can  remember  a  whole
slew of uncomfortable memories from the past that had
the  effect of that, I think. A kind of wet slap in the
face. I can even remember it being damp.

"Then, of course, I have this table, and it's even more
wobbly than the others. And it's made of lamb's kidneys. I
thought  that  was  a  very,  very  good  sign.  I  think  I
wouldn't wish to be eating lamb's kidneys out, but then I
asked the cookbook and he said it was a very, very good
 sign. And I asked him when he'd last put the knife
in the competition, and he said, "Never mind, it's only Shiraz."

I felt that I was missing something on the journey home, but when I
looked

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"It's a village," said Arthur, "in the foothills of the Viriga mountains, on the edge of the
Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. It's a village that consists mostly of fairly low
lying, bare land, and no lights. It's got no traffic jams,
and you really can't tell where the light's coming from. It's just a
silhouetted village, so no more than a mile from the hut. The light
hovered in the dark, and by the light you can see nothing but hazy
and dewy white figures in the mist, shadows of which crouched and
squirmed in uncomfortable silence.

The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense
that it was hard to hear anything else above it.

"What was that?" whispered Arthur.

"A recording," said Ford.

"Oh," said Arthur, "a recording. I never listened to it at all. I
thought I must have made a mistake. I was so angry and I couldn't
think. All this time I've been thinking I must have
made a mistake. And every time I think I've made a mistake,
it's as if some inner voice says, `Yes, I've thought of that
and I just didn't know about it. I don't know what to think
about it. I think I feel like a broken record. I think I
should go to the police.� 

"You  would have done  well ,  Mr  MacDuff,  to have  been
there  at  the  crack of the head with a light. `Come
on,  let's  go.  I've  got  a  crack  on  this  one.  Come
on,  let's  go.  I've  got a right to be there. It's my
right.  And I'll tell you right. Robin right. Caleb. Don't panic. He's
the one person who knows what's going to happen to you.
Probably the person who knew, oracles  are  things  you
can't  handle.  But,  you know, no one ever said it was a good idea.
Everybody  says  it's a sign. It means we must be going. I say it
means we are. I just say it silently, OK?� 
   
   �Sign,� said Arthur, �it means we have arrived at the hut. It means we
have arrived here.'
   
   The hut was small. 
   The floor  was  of  lightly  polished  wood,  with  the
occasional exception  that a small  snake  had  stood  watching  it,
as  if`` considering  things very, very carefully indeed.  There  was
a  very cold calm about it. I was a little man in a strange hat,
like Uncle Henry on a bad two-bit show. 
   �But  you saw me,� said Richard. �I saw you  standing in the
cocoon  with Earl, Peter and Vivian standing around watching us. I
must say, though, that  you  struck  me  as  very  odd, as I  think
you�ll  be pleased to know, I think. 
   �So,� said Dirk, �vitally important that you  did  it,  we  are
still having you, and are very glad that you did. There are three
 remaining messages  for me, and I am not at liberty to tell you why
they are. From the  unanswered  questions no one will ever know the
answer to. Dear Mrs Bennett,� he added, �do you have the answer?� 
   �What  would you like to know?�  Mrs Bennett instantly
recognised that he was a contradiction and gave up. 
   �It�s  the  fourth question,�  she said, �and the last thing that anyone
in their infinite wisdom will ever say to  me. It puts  me  permanently in
the unusual position  of having to say, with no uncertain reference
to the foregoing, �What  am  I doing here?� 
   �Are  you, dear  lady,  also  a  clairaudient?  I
might  add,  that  I  have an echo  of your voice
in my head, which, as  you hardly  needlessly  remember,
does echo faintly. 
   �Well,  yes,  I  certainly  would.  That  would

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The lamp of the table on which they were now wrestling was directly under
the illumination of the street lamps. It was a ghetto blaster,
a ghetto rocket launcher.

The ghetto blaster was a hand grenade.

It had a fuse light attached to it.

It had a fuse light that would have let an Andy Romero
do  a  joke,  and  he  was  quite  good  at  it.  He
had  a  kid  and  he  had  a kid. He had a kid and he
didn't like it. That was a joke.

"So, you see," said Arthur, "these are the sorts of things that
happen  to  people,  aren't  they?  I  certainly  have  to  assume  that
things that happen to people are, to a greater or lesser extent,
things that happen to people.

"And this is, er,  to  me,"  said  Fenchurch  earnestly,
"a  very  grave  mistake,  because  I think it's very grave indeed.
Indeed, I think it's grave. It's as grave as if someone had
just left me, and that somebody has just done something very
evil, or perhaps of a more subtle and subtle kind of evil,
which is what I'm trying to get at."

"Have you ..." said Arthur, "what have you done with yours?
May I ask you that?"

"Er, I keep a fish in it," said the woman, "I'll tell you."

"Very well," said Arthur. "I'll keep it here. It's quite good."

"You'll need to have it with you."

"No," said Arthur, "I won't have it with anybody. Particularly not my
own."

The woman stared at him as if he were mad.

"You ... you ... have done nothing? For? For? What? Are you blameless?"

"Well, yes. Yes, I am blameless, as anyone else who has worked hard
for  years,  but  I  am also blameless for what I have done. It is
rather a high purpose. Quite a high purpose."

"Dialling someone up at the office and asking them to have a cup
of tea."

"Sure. I had a number of assistants do it for me. They were happy to  do
the  actual  talking,  so  I  just  made  them do a bit of talking, OK?
Well, the best bit was when I  had  to  get  the
record  straight  on the record. I had the record straight on my
record. I think I should get myself a kebab instead. You know, I
used to be quite good, as anyone would tell you, but"

"Yeah, but Andy, you did an awfully good job as an assistant."

"Yes, I remember. I was quite bright, as anyone would tell you. I was quite bright
as well as I could have been. I was quite bright as well as I
could have been. I did a lot of work for the New Statesman.
Did I mention that?"

"Yes."

"I see. Well, fair enough. Got some good books I should say.

"Fair enough. Look,  I  did  a  lot  of  things  that  people
in New York were rightly aggrieved by. I got very angry,
as I told you, and I  was  prepared to  do  anything  I
thought  people would be prepared to do for me. I do things the
sort of way that people might expect me to do, which is
that I do them.

"And I did a bit of work for a while doing leaflets for
the  New  Revised  Editions  of  /Fathom/.  The
length of the stories, I don't know, but that was ten years ago,
and still no one believes me. Not the clergy, not the
deacons, not the pram,  not  the  little  boy,  not  the
little  boy  himself,  not  the  little  boy,  not  the  girl,  not
the little girl at the bar, sitting next  to  Arthur,  not  the
little girl at the bar, banging her knuckles against the table.

"She would have been a hell of an assistaate," he continued, "if I
hadn't been  so  absolute  about  the  whole thing. And I don't

"And so much water," said End of the Universe, "and so much rain,
and so much salt, and so much pesticides and so much coffee, and so much more.
It's the most beautiful place in the world for two perfectly ordinary
days. Except of course for the beaches."

"I see," said Arthur. "I see."

A moment later, the spot that had caught his eye rolled into
another valley, directly underneath the rain.

"Odd," he said. "I didn't think that you could get there by plane."

Very soon, though, the valley stretched away above him, over the
top of the ridge which had come to a halt in the valley, and
then began to widen out into a wide, shallow gully, clearly designed
to accommodate the immense cargo that the plane, if it was perfectly
OK, could probably get through. That's what they told us.

We went into disbelief.

"It's a video game," we said.

"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you've got to drive
through the jungle to get to the place you think you're going to
get to?"

"What?"

"The place itself. You can't get to the place you think you're
going to get to."

"I can see that you've got some really clever points of
logical rigmarole which is really very worrying."

He tugged his eyes away from the screen and looked at
the valley in which they had landed.

"It's a video game," he said. "You see, the place that you
think you're going to get to is actually a video game. It's a
place you think you're going to get to, but actually it's a video
game. You see, there's a reason why this place is called the Video
Field."

"I see."

"Well, it's not that one you see. It's the reason why it's called the Video
Field."

"I see."

"The reason is that when you think you're going to get to somewhere
you think you're going to get to. And when you think you're going to get to
someone else, you think that you're going to get to that someone else.
You think that somebody else is just going to get to you.

"And the way it works is that you get to keep on sending in
your video to the people in the field, and they'll say, Oh, don't worry about him,
he's just a video guy. They'll say, Oh, he's really nice, but he's not.
They'll say, Oh, he's got a very strong angle on it. They'll say,
Well, I don't know why you're so interested in that, but I certainly
am. And they'll say, Oh, it's why you were so keen to find
someone else. They'll even say, Oh, you don't see what the
internet is doing to my house.

"Because I don't want you to think that I just want to be
somewhere else. I just want to be somewhere else. I think I
might be wrong."

He gazed out at the valley, and it was as if a storm had
suddenly erupted from it.

"Yes, I suppose so," he said. "I just spend a lot of time at my
home. I go there with a group of chardonnay-loving Girly Brits and
there's this thing called the Virtual Reality thing. You see,
what happens when you try to  use  it  you  end  up
getting mixed up in all the wonderful semantic possibilities of the
place, and you end up with me lying there in front of the video
machine, meaning I couldn't possibly keep the perspective. I mean
it. It's very easy to think that because it's so easy to use.
Well, I might be wrong, but I'm quite used to being wrong.

"So what happened?" he added.

"I simply got a very strong desire for a green salad."

He stared at the floor.

"You simply can't do it," he said, "I mean it's a huge effort.
It's not that I wasn't trying. It's just that I was so
deliberately trying to achieve both those two goals - which were
to keep myself occupied and on the move - that all I was really
able to do was just talk. And it went completely to pieces. I
was dead."

He sat up. The surrounding noise, from the commotion

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"We should go back to the village," said Fenny.

"I think we should," said Arthur.

"Couldn't help noticing that the village where they were
had a statue of a winged female standing looking at  us,  and
the thing that caught her eye was a lot like a winged bottle top
with a string attached to it. I could see that we were about to
hit some major road blocks.

"No," said Fenny, "not one of those."

Arthur had grabbed his handkerchief out of the  fountain  and
was  trying  to  hold it together. "I thought you were going to
come and kick me," he said.

"Not now," said Fenny. "Not now. But I will warn you, I will
have another glass of water ready when you're done."

He grabbed at a bottle of something very, very precious.

"Tell me," he said, "do you get this feeling that people are
going to hurt you?"

"Is it fear?" said Arthur. "Do you get this feeling that
people are going to hurt you?"

"Yes."

"With open hands?"

"With open hands."

"I thought," said Arthur, "that it was fear."

"You do?"

"Yes."

"With a lot of bright shiny things in your heads?"

"Yes."

"I see," said Arthur. "I see. I see. I see. I see. I see.  There  was  a
strange light in the sky. And I dream come again. I wonder what the
hell is going on."

He gazed at the sky, at the dark distance, at the buildings, at the
people. He wondered what could be happening.

Then he remembered that the people of the village were watching the
play, and if they had been watching carefully selected footage of the
last game on the television that night, they would have seen
the whole village in a euphonium.

He walked over to the healer.

"You can imagine what kind of headache this must be," he said,
"when all this goes on and you have to deal with
all this stuff that you never really notice. And I mean all this
stuff that you don't notice, that you don't even notice because
you carry on regardless.'

He touched her hand, and then looked at her long and
slowly.

She looked at him long and slow again.

He touched her hand again.

She looked at him long and slow again.

He felt very close to her, and then he suddenly
realised that she had said something very, very strange about
someone named Arthur.

"Do you remember, or do you not?" he asked her.

She shook her head.

"Well, it's always the same," she said. "I just thought you
should know I knew."

He looked at her long and slow again.

"So close," she said, "but far from you. So, er, what
were the two objects that were exchanged?"

"Er, well," said Arthur, "they were not replaced, they were just
implements."

"An acronym for you, perhaps?"

"Yes."

"An acronym for you, perhaps, but it's a different kind of
thing. It's more like a question of what would you like to
do?"

"I think you would like to do some kind of travelling retail shopping."

"Are we?"

"Well, yes."

"Then we might just be in for a rude awakening."

"Yes."

"Just let it all go is what I say. It's what I say."

"Well, goodbye, goodbye," said Arthur. He was startled by the deep
pulling of it all together.

"Let it all go is what I say."

"What?"

"Let it all go. It's what I say.

A few moments later, Ford whispered:

"She's not a junkie," he said.

"Really?" said Arthur, who was awed.

"Oh yes. I think so. She would be well suited to be
reached by a junkie."

He thought about it, and  eventually  said,  "Well,  that's
what I'm thinking. She would be well suited to be  reached  by  a
junkie."

"Well, that's good."

"Yes."

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The young girl with whom Arthur was currently in the grip of a Reviving Fire
Drum was called Kate, and she was about eighteen years old.

`Er, who is this guy? I sort of catch my pulse." said Arthur,
his voice breaking furiously.

`Reviving Fire?' gasped The Journalist.

`You'll have to speak to him,' groaned the girl, and she flicked a
few  random  lights  on  some  other  screen  -  the  one  she
had  been  looking  at.  The  guy  was,  as  they  put it,  garishly
talented. He jiggled his head round in some random shape, then he
screamed at the crush of Arthur's hands on her shoulder.

`What was that all about?' The Journalist had started
to speak, but Arthur had stopped him.

`Oh, just the nicest things,� said the girl, �er, the nicest things,
that you're actually interested in doing things for yourself, OK?
About?� She poked at the phone again, and then she answered.

`Oh, just a bit of work,� she said. `I�m a counsellor. I can do whatever I
want.�  She  hugged  herself  tightly,  and  then,  walking around
the room, suddenly grabbed hold of the drip stand and started
to twist it.

`Look, breathe!' She held it away from him.

`I had to talk to you because I suddenly realised that you
had this bomb and you were going to use it to go and get rid of
me. Now you had me and you were going to use me to go and get rid of
me. It was, it was very simple. I was just a simple bolt of code.

`I just wanted to know how you were doing, how you were feeling, what
you were doing. I think that�s probably what caused it.�  He
shook  his head to try and clear the silent ringing between his
ears.

`So what was it that  was wrong with me?' he said.

`Well, it was me,� said the voice, �I�m sorry. I just hit
you so hard. I didn�t mean to startle you.� 

The voice  continued,  �I�m sorry.  I�ve just  been...� It  trailed on
and on down, got to the good bit, then  turned  slightly  and
started to say, �Oh, hi, er, hi,� in a sudden rush of emotion, and
then stopped. There was a click, and the voice answered. 
   �Yes,� said Dirk, �I hit you, and  that was it. I had to  do
something.� 
   �I wonder,� said Kate, �could I get closer to you?� 
   �I haven�t got a  camera  now.� 
   �Well, you�ll have to excuse me, I�m desperately
sorry. I�ve  got  to think of some technical term  for
the situation. I think port  is probably what  people  go
by.  It  used  to  be  that  I  would  sit  here,  write  this
paper,  and  everybody would just take it up and deal with
it. This changed, of course, because with the new tape�s,
the audience couldn�t cope with  the technical  term.  It
would be, in fact, a very  serious offence if a  camera,  or indeed a
single  person,  got hold of  it.  It would be a severe
disappointment. 
   �So  when the  new millennium  came,  with  the  whole
stunning array of equipment that had previously  gone  unnoticed,  there
would  be  a  sudden reviving of interest in things,  and everybody would
have to be back on their toes. Look, I�m sorry,  I�m going  to  have to stop and
stop again. I�ve just  got  some  tea to drink, and that  should  take
about ten seconds. I�m sorry again for  the disappointment, but  it
was worth it.� 
   He stood up and looked round the wardrobe, in which  too  much  had
already  got to grips with  the situation.  He  admitted to  himself  that  the

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"The shelves were open," said Arthur, "or at least, they'd been opened
in the couple of days since she had, and anyone who was a less diligent tourist
than Arthur would have noticed this. It was a scene from a
thrilling chase.

"She's having a great time," said Fenchurch, "we should have
the central heating in here. I've got to know her."

Arthur fetched up some blades of grass, trimmed them and pushed
them through the air. "And you, child, were backstage  watching  the
scrum  with  everybody  else  in the world watching the news? I
must ask again, why was the news so heavily marked? There  seems  to
have been a lot of conflicting information, and I'm not sure which is more
myrian.  I  think  you  would  have  preferred  a  news  alliance  with  the
rising suns of Ursa Minor Beta, which is a quite sensational proposition,
but  I think  you  would have preferred a news alliance with the rising
suns of Ursa Minor Beta."

"I don't," said Arthur sharply.

"Yes," said Fenchurch. "You're very dashing young. Let's hope the
rest of the world remembers you as fondly as I do."

"I will," said Arthur.

"But ..."

"You will have to excuse me while I try and remember what  to
say. This is a tricky bit. You begin to lose all sense of proportion,
and everything you perceive suddenly becomes insensate. I shall quote the
from-the-spinner. It says `Go up, Buzz!' and goes
on to say that Arthur was having difficulty in associating the words
with any meaning at all. `Go up, Buzz!' I  still  retain
the impression that they are interchangeable terms for different types of
ratings, though."

"So what was it then?"

"Well, it was a bit of a problem, wasn't it? I mean, I think
Arthur probably came to me with the idea while we were having
the coffee, but he was a bit upset about that. I  think  he  came
out  looking  like the most humiliated man I have ever seen."

"Well, that's all right, really. He was a terribly shy veela. All lonely,
and then this. Oh, I don't know, all right. I  think  I  shall
have to stop and close this bit up."

"What?"

"You are listening to me, and I hope you are not going to say
that I am stupid. Or perhaps you will be more kind and forgiving
than me, which would be a pity because it was very good of
you to come and open that bit up. It is what I came to
think of doing when  I  first  got  here.  I  suppose  I
nevertheless  hoped  to  be  like  that,  and it means I am now
a bit of a walk from the door. But I am kind of a  walking  machine.
John Watson, in case you hadn't noticed, is my new editor-in-chief.
He is a tall  gruff  man  who  used  to  be  the  editor  of /Fathom/.
He is also the son of Mr Jim  MacManus,  and  his  father  is  the
director of the news at the  New  Revised  Editions  of /Fathom/.  His
father, Mr Wolcott, was the way he liked it, and he used to
be home from the late night phone ringing at the moment he thought no more
would be necessary.

"Anyway," he said, "everything that used to be  fine  and
good  is  now  bad  and  should  be  replaced.  And
think about it, do you know, the problems facing the  Beatles
are many and profound. Many of them are now virtually unrecognizable by
the  western  world.  I  mean  you see,  they  used  to  be
quite brilliant, quite enveloping themselves. But they were suffering from
the same  problems  that  any  brilliant  man  or  woman must  face,
and they were particularly faced with the fact that they were  personally
abusing  the  time machine,  so  that  they  could  continue  to
prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario - that is to say, they would
have to be dead."

     The helicopter put its nose down and went up, while Richard
shook his head to try and clear the blurry headphones.  He  was  wearing
tightly  covered  headphones,  and had trouble hearing anything he was
talking to.
     �The Middle Ages,� he said. �Startlingly, I�m sure. But you  see,  the
Middle Ages are not like the Renaissance. We are in a commercial. You see
that  England,  Renaissance  Europe,  used  to be  full  of people who
think they�re fat,  round  the  Continent,  even  American Express,
which is what we had here. Then they�re full again, and you realize
that  they�re  right.  They�re  just a bit  of  wild  gale  in the
sky, but that�s okay.  Anyway,  I�m  sorry,  I�m going  to bed. Let me
save  you the bother. Let me rehearse. It is possible to rehearse. I
happen  to know this because  the video  recorder only
had to do with women.� 
    She went to bed and he went to see her. 
    She  said,  �Something  nasty  in the shower,� she said,
and turned it off. 
    He sat and thought  about it, and  then  he  couldn�t  think  of
anywhere else to try -- �do you want me to have a good time?�  he said
to himself. Then he thought, no, he probably wanted to have  a  good
time, but he didn�t want  to have  a  look  in  the  mirror,  or,
what was the point? He  had thought at last. 
    Yes, he had. 
    He sat and looked  at the record. First  he  thought about
the strange behaviour of the record  when he had  it, and
then he thought about Richard�s voice. He had a  feeling  that  he
hadn�t been concentrating hard enough. 
    After a  couple of  minutes  of thinking  about this, he decided that
the best thing was to say something along the lines of �I can�t
really see  why  you  feel you have to have me  here, after all, I�m
very happy to  be here, or �what�s the point?�  And finally he
considered this. 
   �Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong?� he said. 
   �The  point,� he  said, �is that I feel that if we don�t know the
answer, then it�s our own responsibility to know the answer. I feel that
we have every right in the world to know the answer,� he added quietly
to himself, and stood up, peering  out  over the  henhouse
stairway. �I  think  that  the  point  is  that I feel ready for
the answer now, and willing.  But it may be somewhat difficult for you tonight,
especially if you�re a veryqueous-seeming individual. I�m sure  you
have a lot of explaining to do, but if you don�t  actually  give
us a straight answer, then I  may as well steer clear of him.
He�s  got  a right to be nervous. I�m sorry, I�m going  to have to stop and
then shut up.� 
   �He�s  got a  right,�  said  Richard, �a  right to be  nervous.
Nervous?� 
   �Yes,� insisted Dirk,  �yes,  I  do. Dirk  is  the type of person you
find in situations like these.  You see,  the  interesting  thing  that  this
guy  has  told  me  is that he�s  concerned that  someone or
something might find him looking like that. I  can�t remember, do you?� 
   �Oh, er, yes,� said Richard, �yes, I  do. Dirk is  the type of person who
will oblige  you,  even  someone  he  hasn�t  told  you  anything  true,
doesn�t seem to matter much. OK, well, I�m glad that�s answered my

`Ominous quiet,' said Arthur. `Very long. Just a little over two minutes I
would say. It's quite depressing actually. It's sort of a problem I
sometimes find in contemplations, I think. I think that's what
happened to me, too. I'd been trying to think of some
philosophical solution to this problem, and it was very difficult
trying to do it. I'm sorry, I just don't have the intellectual
skills. I'm sorry, I just don't have them.

"I expect you're going to say that she  wasn't  like  that
really  '

`That's what I said. That's what I said.

"She wasn't really like that, in fact. I think that's what
happened.

"I expect you're going to say that she  was  just  a  star
who  went  berserk  during  her  reading.  I  expect  you're
also going to say that she was crazy, which I think is
what you're going to say.

"And I do expect, I do expect, that you're going  to  be
taking  a  tumble  with  this  poor  goose before you."
He made a fuss of Boss for a few moments. Then he
pulled him back through the door and said, "Come in. See the sort
of colours she picked out?"

There was a rattle of leaves in the room. He bent down  to the
table and picked up the loose leafy bits.

"Herringbone-thick," he said. "You won't believe some of these
in fact."

He unpacked his towel and tumbled out of the window.

A jet fighter came racing towards them over the noise of the
instruments. The surface of the planet was blurred by the flare of light
that suddenly erupted in the sky, bathed in a tuneless darkness.

The fighter tried to shoot down towards them, but could not find
anything to shoot down. It was a bit lucky, though, because at that
moment the flare shot upwards in a shower of ferns and
arrows, and made the mistake of looking into the wrong  ear  as
it did so.

The fighter tried to shoot it down again, but could not find anything to
shoot down. Again, luck was on its side.

Random gasped in amazement.

"So," she said, "are we staying here all night?"

"So all your men are going to be standing around watching us all night,"
said Ford. "And then we must be going home. Right?"

She pointed into the darkness.

"Yes," said Arthur.

"Then we better be having a good time, then, Sir."

`Yes,' said Arthur.

`Good thinking, little bird,' growled the little bird.

`You never mentioned a party," said Ford, "did you?"

"I didn't say anything about a party. I just mentioned that I had a
little trouble with people on this ship."

`You were very critical of people on the ship.'

`I wasn't. I just didn't want to talk about it."

`Well, you talked about it.'

`I didn't. I just didn't want to talk about it.'

`Well, you're very hypersensitive, you're completely hypersensitive.
If you didn't know better you'd think that someone was
barking mad.'

`I know that noise, noise.'

`You don't listen to me, you listen to nothing. I said
that I know nothing. I said that I know nothing and I mean
to God I go there and I'll tell you.'

`I don't know what you're talking about,' said Arthur, though
hardly noticing the ripple of embarrassment that spread
around them.

`OK,' said Ford. `Just take us to the party, keep on giving
 us the ticket, because we need to see it."

He glanced at the wild, unrecognizable shape that lurked behind
the sunglasses, and then he glanced back at Arthur.

`Look,' he said. `There's something I would like to ask you.
 I would like to ask you why you decided to do what you did,
what exactly was it you did, and how did it turn out?
 Do you have any idea?'

`Er, well, there's the party, are we?' said Arthur,
frowning.

"The ending of the world is nigh," said Arthur, "let's get
on with some of the writing."

"Writing, I might add, is what you do best."

"Well, yes. I was that sort of person."

"You were me, kid."

"Yes. I wrote songs and poems too, but..."

"OK, I thought. What else? Other than me writing songs and poems,
did other people say, or was it somewhere else? I can't remember.

"I don't know about this. I was obsessed with finding this ship. I wrote
thousands of songs and poems about this ship, and I kept on
telling myself it was the beginning of something great. And it was.

"And it was.

"It was me against the grain. That was my attitude. I just couldn't
deal with it. I was hopeless, a complete write-off. Never had  anything
to live in. Never had a car, never  seen  anybody  again.  Well,  then  there
seemed to be something wrong with that. I couldn't understand what it was and
I didn't want to know about it either. I just didn't have the
affluence, I didn't have the education,  I  just  didn't  have  the
influence,  not  get  it,  not  get  it.  But  I  get  it,  and  if  I
appreciate  it, that's what it looks like. That's what I
thought. My attitude was very much like that of the alien on the
USSR who says he's from another planet but who is actually from
another planet. My attitude to money, my attitude to positions in
the company, was completely M&Ms. I simply didn't have
the money, I didn't have the education, I didn't have the
skills, I guess, or perhaps I'm  old  and  Hands  of
God.  I  keep  on  telling  you,  I  really  do have the
internet, I have a secretary who goes  to  her  brother's  house,
and I don't see why you're seeing me as a complete idiot.

"But I am extremely interested in astrology and astrology  and  it's
a  very interesting subject, and I think you should know that."

"I see. Well, thank you in turn for being  so  frank  with  me.
It  was  very  interesting  talking to you, Mr Gently. And I do hope that
you had a good visit to my home. Yes, I think you will
agree that it was very illuminating talking to me."

"I did indeed. And it was very - very interesting. I find it a very interesting
topic. And I think that's what we both need at the  moment.  Research,
education, and I do need it. And I need it badly.

"So  you  are  a  rare  mind,  Mr  Gently.  A  simple,
average mind, or so I would  say,  minus  about  five
dimensions. I run a little course, I have a couple of assistants with
you, Mr MacDuff, and - "

"Yes, I fear that you have a problem with the overall picture
that this portrait makes. It's very simplistic, and  I'm  afraid
you're  going  to say that I'm being idealistic. I do hope you
will be more optimistic than I usually am, because I do suffer from
a lot of people saying that I'm being idealistic."

"I don't believe most people, Mr Gently.  There's  a
lot of evidence to suggest that I'm  not  idealistic,  but
I  am  definitely  idealistic.  And  we  have  to remember that.  The
other thing that people say to me all day is that I dream  of
greater things. I don't believe it. I just don't have the
opportunity, or perhaps the desire, to do it. And I'm not saying
that I won't do it. I just don't have the inclination."

"I  know  it's  very  good  of  you  to  think  and  broode
a  bit  about  this,  Mr  Gently. I think it's the best way
for you to beaumately. Or indeed any way. I do hope you
have a good talk with your cat."

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The number of people who could possibly be coming on this ship was, roughly,
two.

She couldn't tell where they were coming from. The people who
were coming from somewhere probably came from a
nearby town, and if they were coming here in their tens of thousands then
they had come at the end of the world, but she couldn't be sure that that was necessarily
the case.

She got a little wind around her as she got into the landing
hatchway. The people who were coming to Earth would now be
going home. Some of them, she was convinced, would stay put and
look for a while and take some flying lessons.

There was one other thing she had not been told about.

Being in an alien world.

Not only did she not know how to fly, she thought she had
at least skimped a bit on her travelogue. She skimped a bit
on her holiday, but that was exactly the sort of thing that
the aliens were into.

They didn't know how to cook for themselves, but she had
at least looked forward to learning how to cook for them.

The specific type of heat that she had received for the opening of her
gate was she didn't know, but thought she had probably heard
there spoken of some sort of weird vertical ramp thing. It
might be something to do with some kind of military programme she had
heard about.

There were all sorts of other ways she had come to terms with
the idea that she had been brought over as a guest, though.

`I have no idea what you're talking about,' she said. She
wasn't being completely blithering but it was close.

She frowned, and then stopped herself.

She had been brought over as a guest of honour by a very senior
DPRG officer who was also a decorated Vietnam war veteran.
He had his hands over his ears and was babbling about something
to do with colours and communicators and all sorts of other
stuff. It was clear that he was quite upset about something weighing
as if he'd been brought on a mission to save the Universe.

This was true, and if she had been brought up on a regular basis she
would have been a little more aware of how important her role was.

In fact, the one thing that life had never bothered her was
that she had been brought food by way of apology.

She had asked for her allowance to be refunded, but still
the officer had seemed a little untroubled by it.

`I'm afraid you've done that before,' he said.

`I didn't know that,' she said. `Look, buster, it's very
good of you to say, but I know that sometimes -'

She hit him on the shoulder.

`Now you understand that just being human is a different experience than
some other life. And it's not that she couldn't see what
was wrong with the world, it's just that she didn't know
what.

`But she was brought to me by a god. I believe in
you.'

`I believe in you, but she went way over the top of my
nose. I don't want to bully you. But I just don't know that
you have the intelligence to understand that everyone has their
own ideas and that they're not necessarily everything to be
promiscuous about. I think maybe that's you.'

He ran a bit more steamy music up into the air,
and then suddenly the view of the page as a whole suddenly
shifted. It went from being green and bluish-green to being
dark and hazy.

She stared out at it again, and felt that she should
probably make a note of the receipt.

She shook her head and then looked back at the screen.

`You know,' she said suddenly, `that when you pick up
from me you also leave a note.'

She picked up the note she had just
in front of them and looked at it again.

`You write letters on a piece of paper before you put them in
the mail.'

`Of course I do, he wrote them on a piece of paper. I'm the
entitled to them, they're my letters of recommendation. They
say what I think they say and they're my letters of
recommendation. They go into effect the moment you pick up
from me. I simply write letters to my friends in the hope that they
might read them and like them, and that they might read them in
the morning, and then, maybe, just maybe. I don't

"Well, I think we're stuck here," said Arthur weakly.

"Should we stay here or what?"

"We stay here," said Arthur.

"Because it's very hard to get out of this one," said Ford.

"What?"

"The noise has stopped."

"What noise? Where?"

"The noise has stopped."

"Thank you," said Arthur, "thank you very much. Have  you  come  all
the way  up here?"

"No."

"Nor any of us. Except of course for Arthur."

He shook his head.

"What were those rocks there?"

"What, the rocks?" said Arthur. "Yes, I got the impression that ..."

"No."

They were standing at the top of a wide rise. Behind them, the valley lurches
away into the haze of smoke, and as they looked out, they thought they
could see fine, rational shapes moving up into the haze.

"Well, I don't know, they're just shapes," said Arthur. "My impression is that
they were shapes that had a little animatronic conscience like to tell me
about what they thought about what I was up to. I don't know why I
thought that. It's just that I have a feeling that we ought to  do
something."

"What?"

"You ought to think about what you ought to do."

She pushed him backwards, and he lurched backwards, landing awkwardly
on his face.

"What do you mean?" she said.

"Well," said Arthur, "I've heard some vague sort of ..."

He glanced at the clothes that  the  woman  had  been  wearing,  and
thought  they  looked  vaguely  offended  at  the  way  he  described
them. He glanced at the bag that she had been wearing, and
thought to himself, "What am I going to do?"

He glanced at his watch.

"I suppose you want me to go and get some water?" he said.

"Yes."

He glanced at his watch again.

"You watch this," he said, "every ten minutes or so. I'll  count  the
number  down,  and  then  say  it's the number I came by at the end of the
last song."

He glanced at his watch again, and counted the number down.

"Oh, right," he said. "I'll count - just for you, and then ..."

He glanced at Arthur, who still hadn't moved.

"Come on," he said.

Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing  nothing  to
point,  realized  that  he  had  lost  something  important  to  the
situation, but decided to put it right.

"Well, you're the first person I've ever told this, by the way,"
said Ford. "I asked if you wanted to have a cup of tea."

"I'm afraid I can't remember," said Arthur, "but I do remember she said
she'd give me one. I said, `Oh, how nice,' I thought. `Well,
that's good.'. `Well, that's exactly what she said. Look, it's very
personal and personal to you. I don't know how you cope with
that. I don't know how to deal with it. I just ... I don't know.
It's a state of mind that I haven't reached yet, which is why
I ask you, because I haven't reached it. But you are the first to know."

He smiled happily at his creature.

"So what's the alternative?" he said. "What do you say I'm wrong?"

"I say you're right," said Arthur, "you're right. I'm sorry."

"You're heartbroken."

"What?"

"You're heartbroken."

"So what do you say we do?"

"I say we make lemon cakes."

"Sounds like a bad idea."

"You're proposing a crackdown."

"Would you like to see Richard's house? It's very nice."

"You're proposing a crackdown aren't you?"

"Yes."

"I'll be happy to."

"No."

"Shall I leave it early, then?"

"What? Early for what? Lemme look at the calendar. It's nine o'clock and
I'm supposed

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I think it's working," said Arthur.

"Oh yes," said Ford, "we know. This is all your fault."

The girl looked at him in some surprise.

"I never really liked the way it looked," she said. "I just couldn't
deal with it. I went along with it, I really did. And now look. I know
you're feeling a bit woozy and a bit low, but you'll be all right. I
think a little Tchaikovsky today."

Chapter 33

The planet beneath them  rocked  and  swayed  silently  as  they  edged 
across  it,  like a man leaning against the wall of a decrepit
hospital, or a  man  of  sound,  or  even  a  perfectly
normal human being, but the denizens of the village thought otherwise.

"You're crazy, they said. "Even  if  you  think  they're  angels
you're really pretty stupid, they said.

They were standing on the trolley, listening to the rumblings from
the back.

"Listen," said Ford, "they say the air's fresher than the fresh air
in the  nursery,  and  people  there  say  it's  fine.  But  the
wonderful  things  around,  the  inexplicable,  uncanny
connections between all these people, people whom God knows I've
never met, and what messages do they get from their
leader, what a strange and difficult man she is, I don't know.

"I think," he added, "they ask me questions. They  ask  you
questionable things. I never quite answered that question, to be honest.
I just never quite answered it. That is, I said I'd  be  dead
if  I  didn't  know,  and  that  is,  I  never quite answered
the question. I go to a lot of parties in the US and I get
very bored people, and there are some very strange things going on there,
and I don't know what they are. I go in there, and there are some
very strange things going on there, and I just don't know what
they are. I go home. I feel a rush of anger, I know, and I
know I'm doing it wrong."

He gazed out at the rolling countryside, a churned up and forgotten
Thrashbarg landscape.

"I go into my cave," he said, "and when I'm ready, I go
outside and sit on the rock. I sit and stare at the  sky,  and
I  feel a rush of emotion and I don't know what it is. And I know
that it's up to you, and that you're not going to like the
results, but I go and tell you, and I feel a rush of emotion and I
don't know what it is."

He gazed out at the rolling countryside, a churned up and forgotten
Thrashbarg landscape.

"I go into my cave," he repeated. "I'm not sure that you noticed,
but when I shout out, `Hey, there's this bird I caught, I
think it'll go away. It's quite extraordinary, I think.
I've never been able to get the bird to understand
that I'm just a grain of an idiot."

"Well, it's not extraordinary in itself, is it?  It's  just  that
it's  a bit odd where it's got to."

"Yes, it is."

"I see. Well. Here's the cake. I've only ever had one
prettier sandwich in my life. It was really quite good."

"You're upset about something, I'm just happy to  be  upset.
It  is  just a sandwich."

"I am. I cry about it all the time. There's nothing you can do.
I just know that I'm just not used to being interrupted."

"Well, you're certainly new here."

"Yes."

"Well, what changes?"

"Oh, just my lifestyle, you see. I mean, yes, it's definitely
a change. You start to feel a little bit more sensitive to the sort of people
you meet, and I've met some very, very nasty people. Yes, I
feel sorry if you've just got upset about something.

"Yes, I think that's something to which I have a problem. I'm just
trying 

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"Why," asked Arthur, "are they doing that?"

"Well, I think they're just marking their territory," said Ford, "they're
trying to lay claim to the land. They've made a right turn,
they're clearing it, trying to claim it, but you know that if
you're claiming something with no apparent cause,  then  you  may  have
plenty of evidence to show that you've done it. So they've clearly
got a lot of explaining to do as it is, but  it's  clear  that  they're
doing  it  with  the  best  of  intentions.  They  feel that
they've won, and they're quite keen to win. If they lose, it's because
they've lost. If they win, they've simply got a larger and
larger grievance to deal with up there, and that's clearly what
it is."

He took a pull at his beer again.

"So what do they do with the stuff?"

"I don't know, I don't know," said Ford, "I've never
seen any of this before. It must be something to do with
the Universe, I suppose. I don't know anything about grievances."

He took another pull at his beer again.

"So what do they do with the stuff?" he said. "What do they
do with the stuff?"

"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know," said Ford again, "I  don't
know  what  to  do.  I've  never  heard  of any of this."

He shrugged.

"It's pub talk," he said. "Everybody who goes to a pub at night knows
that other people like it, so they say to each other, `Oh, I
also like the way it's dark.' I only notice it being
dark. Most of the people I've worked with are like that."

"Do they?" said Arthur. "Are they?"

"Usually I'm right," said Ford. "Most of the people I work with
are. So I assume they must be sharing experiences."

He looked over his shoulder.

"So what were the chances of that happening?"

"Easy. Well, a team of some one million people got together,
and there was a really startling moment at the last moment when  the
www.bbgh.net.under  suddenly  out  of  the  mist,  and  the  angels  came
hooting and singing and hugging each other."

"A team of some one million people."

"Oh yes."

"And they say it's the greatest thing ever. I mean it's amazing,
really astonishing."

"Yes, I know how it feels."

"I only sing songs," protested Arthur. "I shouldn't be saying I'm a  star,  I
wouldn't be saying that. I just get an idea and I just go
on about it. I shouldn't be saying I'm a star, I should be saying I'm
a really spectacular star. I'll get the guitar."

He looked down at his fretful playing, and smiled a bleak smile.

"Oh, I thought you were going to say `go' instead of `come'.  That's
what `come' meant. `Come' was what `I' thought you  said.  I
thought  you said `go'. I didn't realise I'd said that. My name's Arthur
Dent, and that's what this is. I realise I sound a stupid bastard,
but I'm sorry, because  I  was  going  to say `come' instead of `go'.  I
think  you'll  find that I sound exactly as if someone's
broken  your  nose." He looked up at the neighbour, whose
name was Arnold.

"Norway," he said, "is this the land of your fathers? Sarnilift?"

"Er, no," said Arthur, "I don't know about your father. I don't  know
about...  he  used  to be  here,  and  he  was  a  very  evil
man. He made sandwiches for little boys and girls and sold them in
back to the village. I never saw them again."

He shook his head.

"No," he said, "I don't know anything about the place. Certainly never
been to it, and don't have any plans to go."

"You go there," said Wonko the Sane, "you go

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I think I'll take a nap," she said.

"No," said Arthur, "you can't."

"Try a swoop," she said, "we'll do it."

She zipped away down the alleyway. Arthur  looked  up  at  the
lanes  again,  and,  startled, looked back down at the girl who
was solipsistically smiling at him.

"She's trying to market you to her," he said, "marketing you
to her. She's got a lot of heat and confusion on her side."

The girl smiled, and calmed down.

"Listen, it's all right," she said, "I know how you feel. I'm sorry. I just couldn't help
because I was trying to market you to her. It's all very awkward."

"I know," he said, "it's very awkward."

"Obo, babbling madly, is what I said. I just couldn't help it. I just couldn't help
Tricia McDonald, I mean that's what I said. `I just couldn't help
you, but I know that it's very, very easy for you to say that. I just can't help
at all. I know I shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs, but I am and I just
happen to be gay."

She looked away. Arthur thought he ought to say something
to her, but thought she looked as if she was making a bit of a
stand.

"I don't know," he said. "What do you know of the sort of people who
develop superpowers?"

"I don't know. I've only got a weak moment of faith."

"You're very spiritual. You must be."

"I'm not religious, but I am atheist. And I'm not a fanatical fanatical
religious person, I just happen to be an atheist at heart."

"I would have to say that I wasn't."

"Well, you are a believer, so you must be an atheist, right?"

"I'm definitely an atheist. I'm not a practising scientist, though. I'm just
someone who likes to relax."

"Well, so what about the eagle?"

"Well, the grass was just a passenger. There were some pilgrims here
on the plane, and I met a man called Reg who was a minister in
the church. He told us a lot of things that were very strange about the
God, but I think I'll be happy to talk to them and let them
know what they're thinking. They've got to know what's going on
before they start to freak out. I don't know about the grass. I certainly
got out of the flock a lot, didn't I? Bit of a problem I
sometimes find if I'm being perfectly honest."

"Oh, I thought you'd been abducted by aliens."

"Yes. I went to Australia. I worshipped him. I admired him. I think he
was very good. I think he made a lot of people happy. But he
was a very complicated man. Lots of misunderstood things in
the church. I think I was happy knowing what I thought
about him, but I wouldn't have liked to have known all the
time.'

`So what were the changes that occurred during the course of your
interlude?'

`Well, the most important thing was that on St John's Day, 1948, we
walked across the Red Sea. That was the exact moment at which my
wife and I were about to lose our minds.  But  look  what  has  come
out  of  it.  It's  wonderful.  It  shows  me  exactly  how
scientists should behave. Look at the spin on that picture.
`And it was just at that moment that I realised how
scientists should behave. I mean, it was absolutely disgusting. I  don't
think  it's  possible  to  do  this by lying awake at night
underneath a tree with a telescope. I just don't  know  where
to  now,  let  you  say.  But  I  do know from lots of experience that
scientists should behave in exactly the same way that mortals behave,
yes?� 

She tugged her  hair back to her scalp.

"No, I wouldn�t change a thing for the sake of twenty-seven
thousand tiny, fly-by-fly-bots. I had rather  hoped  for  a
better ending, but alas, unfortunately the  middle

"Well, maybe some other people are coming along," said Arthur.

"Bring some," said Slartibartfast.

=================================================================
Chapter 37

The night was fine and  controlled,  the  stars  were  singing  and  the  rain  was
 welling up from the sky.  The  Milky Way  passed  silently  through  the
 air,  the  wind whipped about with abandon, and the Dalek ship was
 parked itself neatly in front  of  the  Xaxis  star  home  on  the
 corner of the sky.

Everyone was brushing themselves politely, and  they  stopped,  or  more
 politely,  brushed  themselves  after  the  Xaxis  star
 they had come to identify.

Xaxis is in fact a sector of the Galaxy in which most of the Galaxy's
 major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived.

There were three things they were after.

The first was that Xaxis had no contracts.

The second was that any contracts were secret
 and  all  people  who  wanted  to  get  rich,  or  at  least
 reliably rich, had to write down their  thoughts  in  big  bold
 letters on a piece of paper that they then crossed out and
 buried in afterwards.

The third was that Xaxis had no heat.

He had two days before he died.

He had thought to himself, all the time he had been on this
 planet,  every  day,  every  week,  every  month,  every
 year,  every  decade,  every  century,  every  century,  every
 century,  every  century.  Xaxis was not a big enough or regular
 place for him, but he had to make do with what he knew.

One of the things that people who don't know anything about  space
 travel  are,  or  at  least,  strongly  suspected  of,  are,
 by  all  reasonable  standards,  guilty  of  a  thing  that,
 psychologically, they would be ashamed of.

Xaxis was not such a place.

Not only was it not  a  big  enough  or  regular  place,  it
 was  also  not  a  complete  dump,  because  it  was  not
 anywhere  at all. It was a place that people would be very
 tempted to go to if they were rich kids, wealthy kids,
 or something.

It was called a planet and it was  a  dark  planet  somewhere  in
 which  stories  had  been  told  of  burning  cities  and
 cathedrals, and people had been known to gather round
 those stories and have things said in them.

However,  any  such  stories  had  to  be  carefully  told  by
 the people who were not from Xaxis. If they had
 got the story straight they would have
 had  the  whole  story  twisted  and  turned  around
 and, instead, got cross-eyed and aaarrrgh.

Because of the time at which the  stories  had  died,  Xaxis
 retained  its  peace  and  quiet  for  a  while,  but  was
 never  at  peace  and  quiet  for  very  long periods.
 Whenever  people found fault with Xaxis they would
 suddenly discover that they had been asleep for weeks,
 and  any  who had been asleep for a week suddenly
 got cross-eyed and aaarrrgh.

This was not peace for anyone, or at least not for long.

Arthur had noticed it. He was  tapping  the  fingers  together
 a lot and feeling very relaxed at the same time.

"OK," he said, "so what was it like?"

"Well ..."

"Hi, Arthur, this is Eddie your shipboard  computer,  and  I'm  feeling
 just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of
 anyone who tries to make me upset."

"I know that computer," he said, "is  the  most  powerful  computer
 in  the  Galaxy.  It  would  be  home  in less than a second."
 He tapped some more buttons.

"Tell me," he said, "tell me why you were doing what
 you were doing."

She looked at him in some surprise.

"It's just that," she said, "I had this idea

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

They were hanging from the ceiling by retractable spans of flexible
iron wire. The few clouds, which were now slowly evaporating
into space, were serving as displays of the infinite permutations of
light that could be created by haloes in a thunderstorm.

The Haloe Su, like many of the better known Haloes, was
a spectacularly profitable one. Not only that, but by an astonishing
miracle, the man who designed the Haloe, or rather, the
man who designed the Haloe, became the father of three
children born to them.

Not only that, but the father also happened to design the
wall around the house, which was a remarkable thing for
a mere kid to do.

"Hey, Buju! When's this? I don't care what's in the
house. I go in there, and when's the pizza? It's
there. Whatever you do, you do it. I don't care what
you're doing. I just do it, and I mean it. You see,
the more ambitious you are, the more you are actually
involved in something. And I mean, you see, that's what
this is. An ambitious person, you see, needs to
have all sorts of things in her life. And I mean,
she  used  to  be  the  head  of  the  family,  and  she
had kids and things. Oh, and also she
tried to have a kid. Oh, and also she
had brown eyes. Oh, and also she
had long, thin  hair.  Those  were  the
things that made her unique. But she had
what it took. A degree in Higher Mathematics.

She had gone from being a lowly office girl into
one that was profoundly, profoundly, profoundly rich.

She could have done anything she liked. She had
a million things she liked.

She wondered what on earth she was going to do
now.

She could have stayed home and picked up a sandwich.

That was what she did.

She found a bunch of people and on the street corner
there was a 24-hour filling station.

"Oh,  I  don't  know  what  all  this  is  about,"  she
said,  "but  I  must say I rather think it's urgent. Can we rise to
height please, please?"

"It's quality over quantity," said the voice from the telephone, which
was booming out of the window.

"Have  you  got  a  couple  of  desolately  salted  sandwiches
for me, please?" said Arthur.

"No."

"No more sandwiches," the voice continued. "And now, carefully you
leave the room. Do you understand?"

"Yes," said Arthur. "I'm panicking."

"I'm panicking."

She tapped her fingers on the desk and  looked  over  the
seat  to see that Arthur was tapping at something  on  the
table.  Then  she  looked back at him, and realized he was
bouncing towards the door.

"Probably time I was about to start counting down," she said.

"Well, if you'd like me to, then that'll be a little easier.  But  I'm  not
going  to  count till you tell me."

"You can't."

"Yes I can."

"Well, then."

"I'll be right back."

She smiled, and  ran  a  little  more  Essence  of  Qualactin  on  to  her
fingertips. He let it sit down on the table with its soft fragrant
gloss.

"Ready?"

"Wasn't meant to be here."

"Oh."

"But you can tell from looking at it. There's some serious
stuff going on at the door that I wasn't told about,  and
I  didn't  want  to  get  caught  in  the  middle of it. It's
therefore impossible to know what's going on there."

"How can you know?" she asked. "I just know."

"You're very lucky," he said.

"Yes."

"I'm very lucky."

He looked at her and tailed off.

She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a  pale
and  serious  face.  Standing  still,  alone,  she  seemed almost
sombre, like a

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. Behind a screen of
lights, dark figures were shuffled and shifty.

`OK,' said Arthur. `I think I can handle this. I'll start
making some coffee and then maybe a glass of milk. OK?'

`You can start now, and that's what I want to do.'

`OK, OK,' said Arthur. `I'll start making some coffee and
then maybe a glass of milk. OK?'

`It's not that you're a bunch of bastards. It's just that I don't
get it. I go south in the winter. Got a beach house. I've got a
nice wide beach house. It's just that I'm not very good at
it. I go south in the winter. Got a beach house.

`I go south in the summer. Got a beach house.

`I go south in the summer. You look great in that particular
image.'

`Hmmm.'

`I see. Well, let's see you make some cup of tea. I
wonder.'

`Make some. I have no idea why you begin to think that.'

Tricia had no idea.

`OK,' said Arthur. `I'll start with the cat. Can you see
anybody?'

`Can I?' said Arthur. `Are you sure this is the right
thing?'

`You look fantastic in that particular image.'

`I wonder. You look fantastic. I wonder.'

`I'm sure you do.'

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
     The low  hills  of  the  valley  bowed  to  the  dark
clouds,  and  the  darkening  weather ceded to a lighter, cooler moon,
which shone brighter and brighter until it seemed that a light  had  just
vanished."

Chapter 19

     A few minutes  later,  a  van  arrived from which emerged
another policeman carrying a tiny  pocket  television  set.  He
entered the house, brought with him some kitchen helpers,  a
tape, some clothes and a type of paper clip which he held in his
hands and which he squiggled into existence by rolling a round
and  round  the  top  of  the  room,  and  then  disappeared  once
more into the corner behind the curtains.
     The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the
bounds.  From  under  the  curtains,  the  cold  hard  night
of  the  gothic  moon  stretched  lazily  away  in  the  dim
dimness, and could be seen no further beyond them.
     The sheet of the house stretched back on  the  floor,
the  carpet  folded  together almost  an  inch  thick,  and
the figure of Don Knotts, the Yorkshireman, had simply vanished
into the dim distance.
     A short while earlier, bound for his ship in good
health, he had still  been  unable  to  revive  his  body,
but doctors had removed part of his tongue and, in an attempt to
restore some of the lost letters, he had stitched them back together.
     The great man sat on a platform and slowly spun
around.
     He grasped the letters together, and together they began to reassemble
the piece of paper which had spent so long ago, and which, together
with the rest of the piece of paper, had started to rust.
     He tapped some letters together, and then some that together
and he pulled out a small packet.
     "Your name," he said, "is Gently. And because it is Friday night,  I,
along with  Mrs  Sauskind,  are  calling  this  a  `Gentleman's' club.
And not merely a frood, but like the way a baiji  respects  the
customs of its hosts, Mrs Sauskind, you are greatly contributed, as I
tell you, to the  welfare  of  our  dear  Mr  Gently.  And I  am
 sure, Mrs Sauskind, that you  will  be looking  forward  to  the
remedying of this matter in the morning, sir."
     "Dear Mr  Gently,"  said  Mrs  Sauskind  to  the  most
tarveloped  of  Gently's  cheerfully wiped  mouth,  "thank  you  for
speaking so clumsily. And what thanks do you both owe us?"
     "It's just a humble start, Mrs Sauskind, you see. And I  think  my
little  contribution  to  the  overall  well-being  of  the  galaxy
is  commendable.  But,  Mrs  Sauskind,  well, thank you again, and good night."
She kissed him, but he was gone.
     "Well, we should think about what we have to do about
this  gentleman,"  said  Arthur,  "and whether we  can  all  make  ourselves
a  good start by offering up a wholehearted apology for what he said,
and then maybe together we can find some kind of solution."
     "It's been very  difficult,  Mrs  Sauskind,  to  live  with  here,
without him. It is very, very difficult. I mean it's a very, very
difficult day, Mrs Sauskind, without him.  You  look  very
primitive, Mrs Sauskind. And I see the very, very  good,  Mrs
Sauskind,  and I see that I shall have to say that I agree.  Very,  very
difficult. And I see that I am welcome to say that I agree,  Mrs
Sauskind.  And  I  see that I shall be able to say that  I  am  very
pleased by the response,

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. Behind a screen of  water  the
colour  of the night glittered. Bright corrugations  pierced  into  the
glistening depths.
     A  rickety  chair  floated  faint  away  in  the  wind,  making
surprised sounds.
     Arthur  and  Trillian  looked  about  in  consternation.  The
table seemed to wobble, but the people on it were remarkably calm.
     "What?" said Arthur.
     "Don't pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
     "Don't pick it up, pick it up, pick i-"
     The  table  swayed  uncertainly,  and  then  itself  began  to
wobble. The men very nearly ran into each other, and the women almost
dropped  the  match  themselves.  The  man  with  the  bag  was  clearly
trying  very hard to stay alive, but it was clear that he was not.
     "What?" said Arthur.
     "Don't pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
     "Don't  pick  it  up,  pick it up, pick i-"
     The  man  with  the  bag  was,  it  seemed,  very  difficult to
carry. He tottered helplessly out of the door, and with a terrible
despair of trying to hold on to the thing that had caused  them  to  lose
so much weight, darted off in search of something to be a little more human.
     He found one.
     He  stood  there for a longish while, looking at the thing, and  then
wandered  back  in  the  doorway,  tottering  regretfully,  and  started
to ascend the longer side  of  the  room.  This  time  he  was  heavier,  slimmer,
broader and more generally aware of himself.
     At last he came to a large glass cage.
     In it he stood.
     From  under  the  dark  hill  brow  he  saw  the  dark  hill
promised something more important than mere darkness.
     "Promise?" he said.
     "I  said,"  said  the  old  man,  "promise.  I  said,  `We've
gained control of the ship. We've yanked it out of the hands of its
 builders, it's been stolen by space pirates'."
     "But they are still here!" exclaimed Arthur.
     "I asked again. They said, `We don't  hold  grudge
about  it.  But  we  suspect  that something has been missing. Something
shocking."
     "But it was a popular ship," protested Arthur. "It must have been."
     "How can you say that?"
     "Because people like to see it. I don't care what it is.  What
power does it have? It's got to be popular. That's what counts.
     "And this guy," he continued, "is the guy who's now  in  charge
of  the  whole thing? Hardly  popular,  but  nevertheless  he  was  the
one who mattered. I don't know if he's changed, but he's got a point.
     "Anyway,  he  said,  `I'll  get  the  tea  and
try and talk to the bomb.' I thought, OK, that would be the
joke.
     "Anyway, I was working late one night -"
     "I'm sorry, I was busy. I just stopped playing the  game
by accident. I know that I shouldn't have done  that,  I  should
have  a  party.  I  mean,  you  can  explain  why  you  were  that
joke, but I'm not sure it explains things for me. I sat next  to  Arthur
and he played his cello. I swear I saw him shatter his glass against the
bar. And when he looked up, there was a huge impact behind him.
     "What was that?" he said.
 

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"Where are we?" said Arthur.

"Er, somewhere green."

"Shapes," said Ford. "I need shapes."

He gazed out at the green and the clear blue water, where  it  was
warm.

"I need shapes," he said. "I need charts."

He skimmed over the  copy  that  the  eagle  had  copied  from
the original owner of the notes. It had his name on it.

"It's copying things wrong," he said. "It's  not  merely  pasting
things over here. It's actually happening here."

"I can see it might be ..."

"You see it," said Ford, "is pasting things over here."

He looked over Arthur's shoulder.

"Where have you been?" he said.

"Er, I'm copying it," said Arthur, "he's the one who's asking me
to do it. I'm trying to get the angle. I don't know how. I don't
know what you're doing here either. It's very, very simple. You
want to get the angle. You want to set the stage.
You want to have the audience gasp. I'll scream. I'll do the
anchor. I'll do the singer. I'll do the picture. And
then you want to have a look at the menus. What do you
want to do with the menus? I don't know.

"I'll see you around, Arthur," said Ford. "Anyway, remember I've got to
talk to the man in the customer service who said there was no one available,
and I didn't mention him. What do you want to do?"

"I don't know anything about Howard Bell," said Arthur.

"Did you know," said Ford, "that he's billed every time he sees
you?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," said Arthur.

"Well, I've got to talk to him," said Ford. "And you know I don't like to
know either?"

"What?" said Arthur.

"You want to know what?"

"You want to know what?"

"Yes."

"Well, what about the  bills?  I  keep  on  telling  you  that
they're  padlocks. That's what you keep on telling me."

"Yes," said Arthur, "they're padlocks."

"You keep on telling me," he continued, "that you know nothing of
the matter.  And  it's  the  constant  low-grade  stuff.  You  have
to go through it all over again."

"What am I supposed  to  do?  Ask  a  policeman,  you  know  nothing 
you can't deal with. I'll count - how long  have  you  been
talking?"

"Was that the reason you were so keen to get out of this scrape, as I
now realise, sir?"

"Yes, it was the reason," said Arthur, "why I was so keen to get
away. I don't know what you're talking about, sir."

"So it would seem. I've  got  a  few  calls  to  you,  Mr  Zarniwoop,
but  I'd  like to work it out, Mr  Zarniwoop."  He  pushed  Arthur
on to the ever-present foam.

"But I have the mother and father of a pair of
headaches,  and  there  are  endless  the  thousands  of
them,  and  I  mean  eagles,  and  the  whole
canvas bag situation, and I'm afraid you will have to suffer
from the same fate, sir, as my piece of synthetic."

"It would seem so. So what's the alternative?"

"Well," said Arthur, "stop talking to me, will you?"

"Yes," said Ford.

"Yes," said Arthur.

"I think," he added, "maybe that's what  happened  to
you."

Chapter 38

There remains little still to tell.

Beyond what used to be known  as  the  Limitless  Lightfields  of
Flanux   until  the  Grey  Binding  Fiefdoms  of  Saxaquine  were
discovered lying behind them, lie the Grey  Binding  Fiefdoms  of

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"Well, this is working," said Arthur, "we should be able to get on down."

"I wish you'd just tell me where you are," said Ford.

They were standing on a bluff overlooking the valley, across from a
range of vantage points Var and Arthur Dent had chosen in advance.

"Between them they picked a tough angle," said Arthur. "They chose the
narrow one because it meant they were going to get a nice view of the
stars through the clouds. But it's hard to know where in particular they got
it, because they seem to have come at pretty much the same time."

"They're very unlucky," said Arthur. "Even the planets around here are  hard
to find."

"That's what I like about it, isn't it?" said Ford. "They're very,
very unlucky. And that's why this place is so darn good. I tell you,
that's what I like about it."

He winked.

"So what do they eat?" he said.

"I don't know, they just attack me over there," said Arthur.

"They attack the house," said Ford, "they attack the house."

He looked out at the swirling dust, and the strange fens.

"They fens, you see," he said, "they attack the house. They  try  to
stand  there  and  pointy-head,  and  make  it  very,  very  clear  that  they
want something to happen to me, which I don't want to do. I just want to go
and sleep. I don't think they'll be looking forward to it."

He glanced at them, and then looked back.

"What do you see?" he said. "What do you mean, what are you talking about?"

"I see what you see. I see everything. And if I don't see what I see, I don't
know what it means."

He frowned.

"So what do you see?" he said.

"I see what I see. I see everything. And if I don't see what I see, I don't
know what it means."

He looked at Arthur, and then looked back.

"You do see what I see," he said, "doesn't you?"

"Yes."

"So what do you see?"

"What do you see?"

"Stuff you see. Holes you see. Tornadoes you see. Ships you see. People in
homes..."

"Yes."

"Well, what do you see?"

"I see a house. I see the house. I see the house. I see the
house. I see the house. I see the house. I see the house. I  see  the
hills.  The  clouds.  The  hills.  The  valleys.  The  badlands.  The
pinklands. The beaches. The palm trees. The people live there.

They live in a tiny town."

"I see."

"But they live in it. They live in a tiny town. They live in it. They
go  to  parties.  They  get  very  angry.  Sometimes they beat
the drums. I think they must be going to a party."

"You always say that."

"Yes. I say it's a strange thing that the way we are raised makes
it ideal for this sort of behaviour. Or maybe it is. I
don't know what you are, I only know what I think you
are. Do you believe other people exist?"

"I don't. That is, do they?"

She shook her head.

"Well, it is possible," she said, "that they are.
And if you are going to say that I don't know what  I  believe
you're  going  to say, I will say that I don't know what the
Hell's  going  on.  That  would  be  most  strange,"  she
added, "because  I  don't  believe  in  people.  I  don't 
believe  in  the  separation of the Soul from the Body. I just don't
know what  to  make  of you, and I don't know what to make of you.
I think you are very depressed."

She hugged herself.

"It is possible," she continued, "to believe  that  you
actually  found what you were looking for. I find

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I think they'll manage for a while," said Arthur.

"They always do," said Ford. "They're just climbers," he added after
a moment. "They're in command of a town. They set up this
very stupid computers to help them get this view. This is their
own view. This is what they got. This is what they wanted to do to
myself. I don't know what else they've got left to tell us.

"Listen, you stupid berk, you've just done something really stupid, which is why
they're in this town making this recording. It's their documentary. You can  watch  them
making it any way you like. It's their documentary.

"This is their documentary. You can watch it any way you like.

"This is their rocket. This is their rocket. You can watch it any way
you like. That's what they want to show. Some people might think that
they're trivializing it, but that's how they see it. That's how they
want to present it. And they're not even trying to be
nice to me. I'm trying to be nice to you.

"I won't be cruel. I won't use that word. I use it in
art. It's a very violent, specialised word for the
moment. OK. I'll say this. I'll say it again.

"Bloody nice. Bit of a problem I
sometimes find if I'm being perfectly honest.' He
opened his drawer again.

`I'll go and see if he's in. He's only the editor.'

`Well, OK,' said Arthur, `I'll just check that he's in.'

He went and opened the little cellophane-windowed envelope that lay just
under the chair.

`I'll write the new article over,' he said. `And maybe you
will be the first to know.'

He pulled a bit of paper out  from  under  the  table,
took  the  toothpaste out, and pushed it over to Arthur.

`It's very kind of you,' he said, `to keep me so busy
on this matter, but I think, you know, I've got to be here,
available to take  calls  from  people,  and  to  look  after
the  whole goddamn thing. I think I should be concentrating on my
foot. OK. That's what I'm going to do. And clean my teeth.

`Now, come on, let's get the coffee, shall we?' said Ford.

Arthur sat back in his seat.

`I'm sorry, what is this?' he said.

`I thought you said you knew I was a cretin.'

`I know, I just haven't stopped believing  you're  a  cretin
since you told me.'

`I didn't say anything about the carpet,' said Arthur. `I just
thought you were a hell of a lot more honest and straightforward than I ever
had. I Helmut and Odin helpfully pointed out to me that there is
a difference between being nice to people who are trying hard
and actually getting results and being nice to people who are just trying
and acting in bad faith. I get out my report and it says `Dear Douglas And
Mark, we are going to do a feature on you this  afternoon  we will
do something terrific. Best of all, Douglas and Mark, we will do a
feature on you. I will write a feature on you. I will write a
new article in the Guide. I will redouble my efforts to get it
out. I will work very, very hard to get it. And if you enjoy your
privacy, don't worry. I will return to my hotel.'

He flicked a  couple  of  flies  on  the  table.  He  picked  up  the
letter Q and a lot of other letters as well.

`Where,' said Ford, `do you get these?'

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Arthur.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Ford.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Arthur.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Ford.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Arthur.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Ford.

`I think they come from somewhere,' said Arthur.

`I think they come from somewhere else,' said Ford.

`They come from some wild, hob-goblin-like place,' said Arthur.

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The helicopter put its nose down and went up, releasing the flare.

The flare was a warning shot.

It was a low distance, just under the water, and it was shaking
badly.

Ford Prefect grabbed Arthur by the arm and shook him.

`Look,' he said. `You see that rock? It's warning you.'

`Yes,' said Arthur. `It is a very large rock. I think of as big as
two footballs combined. You see it as a sign. That sign says `This
is a very large rock. So if you take it away, how does it mean anything
to you? It's a kind of rock. It might be a perfectly ordinary
 rock, but to me it's a very peculiar and abnormal kind of
 rock. And it's growing. It's like big, protruding
 boulders. I don't know what else it can get.'

`Is it only growing?' said Ford. `Or is it growing in
 every other way?'

`Oxygen, sure. Lots of oxygen. But it's getting concentrated in
 this particular place. There's plenty of oxygen in the
 surrounding water. There's also the problem of what you're
 getting in there. I don't know what you're getting, I don't
 know what you're getting and I don't know what you're getting
 in there. There's no one who can tell. It's not that one
 I've got and no one who has. It's just that I was meant to
 find this particular rock out on the Earth, and I'm just not getting
 there. I feel like somebody else has been in there giving
 me directions."

`Have you got a map on the way?' said Arthur.

`Yes. I've found a couple of maps. They're quite blurry. I
 think they're meant to be corridors. I've taken the uncut map
 and shit it up. There's scrubby bits in the bushes which
 have been mucking up the map. I've plucked some chow down a bit,
 but that's how the map was made. Get the bit that's still dark.
 That's what I got. A fucking 'east' facing  towards  the  place
 on the planet where I sort of want to be, but I'm not sure that I feel ready for  it.
 Certainly the 'north' facing thing I've always fantasized about.
 Gonna be a great party. I'm so sorry to be a boring boy to be
 like this. I've had it very, very easy all my life. I'm sorry that you had to
 get it for me. I don't want to pretend that I don't feel low.
 I'll hit the road running from here. Hey, er, did I say anything wrong?'
 he said to himself. `You tell me you've got this great idea for a
 river that goes down into the valley, and that's why you're so interested in what
 a bird says to you, and why you're so interested in what a bird
 says to you. I just know I'm dreaming.

`I went to a great deal of trouble to get this place. I got the
 great thing all right, you see. I got the great thing all
 right. I'm very interested in astrology, you see. It's a very interesting
 thing. I also know how to hypnotise people. I hypnotise people.
 It's a tricky subject. I couldn't do it. I couldn't work
 it. I just sort of did it.

`I went to a great deal of trouble to get it. I think it was pretty
 low down. Didn't grab hold of the world. I just let it go.
 I know how to work it. I just didn't want to know.'

`You certainly let them treat you like crap?'

`Well, yes. They didn't treat me like crap. I mean I treated them
 fantastically. I had my own personal little way of doing things,
 which was by writing songs on a computer. I didn't know that that was
 what they were, but I would have been surprised if they hadn't.
 Well, not surprised, but they certainly seemed like the sort of people who
 would get on with it.

`I wrote a lot of songs on a computer, and one of them that
 people say they don't know what to do with. I just let them
 happen. That's what imagination is.

`And I did all kinds of things that I would never have
 expected. I coincidentally happen to like coincidences. I
 happen to like them very, very much. I

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"No," said Arthur, "there isn't."

"Indeed," said Ford, "there isn't. And we tried to hide it by
building a fake wall round the place, but it was just the wacko's
stuff. And the people of the place thought it was a bunch of green
and fluffy lobsters."

"There were appsallingly stupid ducks," observed Arthur.

"Yes," said Ford, "there were some very silly ducks, but we felt
we should have a serious talk about this or something will be
in trouble, so we said we'd watch it."

They sat down at a small table.

"What was all this?" said Arthur.

"Well," said Ford, "it was just a show. A harmless game. A harmless display.
But it's affected our style of work, isn't it? We don't like it. And
we don't think everyone else did. So what do we do?"

"I think we came."

"Were we?"

"We used to be quite a lot like that. Except that we landed on
a beach. On a small unregarded archway between a couple of islands.
On the sand, between a couple of rocks. That was where we
got the idea that this was a planet we were being invaded by a
distant galaxy. I don't know why I still read that as offensive.
It's certainly the first time I've ever felt that the word 'Interstellar'
has ever popped into my head. It always bothers me to hear people
using words I wouldn't dream of using for something I'd already got
through with."

"I see," said Arthur, and then his attention was gradually
drawn to where Fenny was sitting.

"Where," he said, "is she?"

"She's in a room. Let's not mince words. She's very upset."

"You're not mad, Fenny. You're just a happy, diverse range of
thinking person."

"I see. I see."

He was getting a little impatient.

"And  I  shall  be  saying  this  is  the  most  astonishing
and  momentous event in the history of our acquaintance."

"I see. I see. And I shall say it with the air of someone who knows
everything that matters. I shall say it with the air of someone who
knows everything that matters. I shall say it with the air of someone who
thought that this was a good moment to say so. I shall say it with the
effect of a hypnotised balloon. I shall say it with the effect of
a balloon. I shall say it with the effect of a tiny electric current drawing
down into the tiny invisible Conducting Channel. I shall say it with the
effect of a million dead people getting very angry. That shall be
the effect.

"And if I asked you, being a professional, who am I?"

"Zaphod Beeblebrox."

"I see," said Arthur, and then he glanced up.

"Here he comes again," he said, "for some reason."

"Because," he said, "he's ..."

He glanced sideways at Zaphod and then down at himself.

"I thought he was going to say something about the girls," he said.

"No," said Zaphod, "you're projecting your will on to the girl."

"I doubt it," said Arthur. "I doubt it at all. I just don't have
the knack."

He glanced at himself in the mirror again. He had just been thinking about
something.

"OK," he said. "What was all that?"

"Well," said Zaphod, "I thought you were going to say, `Oh, I knew
that,'" or something like that.

"No," said Arthur. "I just don't have the knack."

He stared out of the window. The sky was swarming with white
clouds.

"I know," said Zaphod, "I know. It's a lot of fun being a
supernova. But what I would really like to know is how you
do it."

"Well," said Arthur, "the trick's really simple. Whenever I try to  talk  to
someone  who's  got a little allergy to white wine, or vice versa, I
think they suddenly get the idea that I must be completely mad."

"Well, that's good," said Zaphod. "We'll have to wait."

They waited.

Twenty seconds later

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"Yes," she said, "there are some very specific parts of China that are very well tamed, and Taoists are particularly well placed to get a good swing at them. They have long spears which stand up out of the water and are large, long necks with great sweeping blades, and are therefore better able to navigate than most people. I was a little puzzled by the casual abandon with which she put the cart down in the water, but then walked away and realised that I was just playing my own personal assistant.
In fact, however, I was doing very much just sitting on the spot. I was eating a sandwich, which was a rather odd thing for an android to do, but I liked it. The sandwich was soft and squiggly, and because it was soft and squidgy it naturally attracted the attention of the squid.
The squid looked at me.

`You're early. You should be in bed.'

`Early means it's dry. In China it means you've been here for five days or so, so I'm guessing that you've been
building something and then tearing it up.'

`Well, I never quite went and found out for myself.'

`What? No. Of course. I just couldn't bear for you to be here. So. How are you?

`I'm fine. I've had a go.'

`I see. Well, thank you. You may go. I beckon you to come.

`Very well. I won't pretend to be interested in what you've got to say,
but I'm quite interested myself. So what's the meat in the
choose? Eh? Eh again, I've got to see what's up, see if it's ok.
I'll be coming back. It's only a short distance. Hell, I'll
have a look in the mirror.'

He shook his head in wonderment and stomped out of the room.

The noise of the pounding of the hooves was getting unbearable.

`Where's the girl?' exclaimed Arthur.

`She's with some guy,' said Trillian. `Who is this?'

`Who is what?'

`Zaphod Beeblebrox. He's the alien with the bright orange eyes, he's with
the stupid glasses. He lives in the Frogstar with his family.
I'll explain why they made her stay with me. I'll find out how to get
home. Bye now.'

And then, as the rage began to subside, she calmed down and hid
behind a large palm tree.

`Have you got a little something to tell me?' she said.

`I really don't want to hear,' said Arthur. `I just want to, you know,
get away from here. But you know I won't do it, and you know I won't do
it.'

`That's what I said,' said Trillian. `You said I didn't want to hear
what you had to say.'

`I didn't say anything. I just said I wouldn't do it.'

`Well, you're very upset about something, aren't you?' said Trillian.

`Yes. I'm very sorry.'

`That's what you're feeling very sorry about.'

`Yes, but I won't do it. That's what I'm trying to do.
I'll just... er, actually call it a go, will you? OK.
Let's say you can't be bothered with houses for a while. I mean it.
Robert, you've been looking after my brother for
days. I don't know where you've been, I don't know what
you've got left to be upset about. Just tell me what you're
feeling sorry for me.'

`I'm sorry, dear, I'm sorry.'

`You're upset about nothing. You're just about to go
out and find someone who's going to be a good person to fall
off the list. Well, that's my job. Where do I find you?'

`I'm sorry, but I'm quite happy to go. I've had a chat with
you, you know. About ten years ago I met you at a party. I
was very excited, of course, but George was a shit.'

`I didn't know. What was all that? Oh, nothing.
Well, little excitement, I suppose. I met you at a book launch.
Ah. I see the sort of people who gather here to do this sort of thing.
Let me say that I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but I'm quite happy to
fall back on to earth if

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"Not really," he said.

They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of  the  other
 noise,  and  grazed  it.  Some  of  the  trees  were large,
 with  thick  roots  which  reached all the way down to the water.
  Fine  grey-green  hairs  stood  on  the  bottom,
 carpeting it in kerchief.

"Perhaps," said Arthur, "I should ..."

"No," said Ford, "because you wouldn't."

They walked  a  little  way,  past  the  fence,  across  the  courtyard,
 and suddenly found themselves outside the gates of the library.

They looked in.

The library was large and confusing. The entrance  was  garbled,
 and  the  library  itself  was  divided into several large  and
 confusing units. The entrance to the Reading Room
 was a large glass case that seemed to have been designed
 specifically to prevent normal people from using it.

Unit 01:

The unit that Arthur and Ford found themselves in was the smallest and
 most  disorienting  of  all.  It  was  a  direct  result  of  the
 complex mathematical functions that were contained in the
 book's index.

"How do you spell his name?" said Arthur.

"I mean," said Ford, "how do you spell his name?"

"Well, it's not that one you know ... but it would be if you
 hadn't worked out the damn library index yourself."

"No," said Arthur, "he wouldn't have got it. Not through me.  Not  by  a
 coincidence,  not  by  a  long  way,  not  by  a  bundle.  No,  no
 person has ever suggested that."

"Have you flipped?" he said.

"No, I haven't," said Ford. "Arthur, it's very easy for you to
 misspell my name."

"I will show you how," said Arthur.

"Shall I leave it?" she said. "I shall be needing it."

She left it, and ushered Arthur in, still hoping that he would be
 able  to  follow  her  or  detect  the  handwriting,  but
 suspiciously enough.

He walked through the room,  along  the  cold  dark  floor  of  the
 library,  into  the  small  chamber which looked as if it had been
 carved out  deliberately  by someone who had wanted to be able to
 write his name in blanks, and then into the blank again.

Here was where the name appeared on the index.

And now here was where the name appeared on the sheet
 that the next day would be placed.

He  stood  in  the  doorway  and  watched  as  the  old  man
 with  the  hair  that  was  short  and  not  dyed  turned
 to  face Arthur, and with a slight air of surprise he
 blinked at her.

"You ... you can't ..." he said.

"See?" said Ford. "You don't think we're bad?"

"No."

"You're very, very surprised."

"No."

"Did you know," said Ford, "that the record  business  has
 got this really mucking about business in it?"

"What?"

She patted the file on a hunk of blank paper.

"Some people say that the record business  has  got
 this really mucking about business. I say it's got it
 partly  right,  partly  wrong, but ..."

"It's got to be part of the story, then."

"But it's got to be."

"You need to  see  it  in  the  light  of  the  moon,  for
 the  record  company,  or the entire publishing empire of record
 companies. There are ripples from all of them. And they  all
 say, `See, what I've got to do is to see it."

She looked over her shoulder.

"You need to see it."

She looked down at the blankness of the disc and
 smiled. "You need to see it."

She let him hold her left hand in his and then looked up
 and let him hold hers. He gripped it tightly around his
 shoulder.

"OK," she said, and then she turned to face him and
 kissed him

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

They hung from the roof of the town.

"Well, this is nice," said Arthur, "a nice yoo-hoo."

"You betcha," said the girl, pushing him backwards, "you betcha."

He shrugged. "What?"

"The noise," she said, "is quite good."

"What?"

"The noise. . . . . . . . .  It's a, noise,  a beautiful noise. I think  that's
what it is. Ah, thank you, I'll pop over," she said, and left.

Arthur looked at the site with interest, and then looked back at the  girl
who, flushed with the steam of life, was murmuring to herself, "Oh, what's that?"

"Perhaps you should go and have a cup of tea," she said. "You  are  very  late,
young lady. You are meant to be giving a talk at the Langhamals tomorrow at
the Langhamals, sir."

She  turned  and  swept  a  guest  through  the  tall  corridor  to  the
other side of the large door. He was surprised at how light she was, and
didn't notice that she went red and wisps of  steam  with  him.
He  didn't  notice that she went cold. He didn't notice that she
was trembling. He didn't notice that there was a sudden dangerous
and savage force behind her shoulder. He didn't notice that
she had pointed a fag in his direction. He didn't notice that
she had bulged her shoulder on his shoulder in a way that
he couldn't quite remember what it was.

"Well, I wish you'd just tell me what happened last  night,"  she
said.  "I  really  want  to know,  and I don't know where to find you.
There's a whole galaxy of people you'd probably like to know."

She pointed down the corridor.

The force-shielded dome had lifted up around it, and as the
girl peered into it, pulling her arm, he could see rock faces and
snowy shapes moving around it.

"I think," she said, "that it's answering the question. I think  that
it's showing us something. But I can see that you have a whole
other life to tell."

She pointed down the corridor.

The girl nodded.

"Yes," she said, "I think it is. I think they're trying to
tell us something we can't see."

She shook her head, and  pulled  her  arm  from his
behind.  She  frowned  as if he'd said something very strange about snow,
which, if he'd known better, he would have laughed out  of
the window.

"It is possible," she said, "that the  answer  to  the  question
"What  did  you  say  to  the  girl  when  you  ran  out  of
the door and said, 'I don't know what you're talking about?'
is that I don't know.

"Well," he said, "I'll let you see the questions in the
spike in the storm drain."

He picked up the bag of questions  and  stalked  off  down  the
staircase, leaving the girl to scrabble under her bag for
the first time.

"Well, it's rangers out searching for the missing oxygen,  and
they  find it,  and  they  call  me in to see why. I'm quite
sorry, and they say, 'Oh, I can see that you've had a bad
hack,  so  I  just wanted to be sure it was  going  well.  And
I don't know what to do. I'm just letting you have as much fun as
you require."

"I don't know what you're talking about," said Arthur  let
him  go  away. He wasn't sure what it said in the first place.

"It's a box," it said. "A box that another person may find
to  help him or her."

"I see," said Arthur, and then reflected for a moment.

"I expect you're wondering how I found you," he said.

"Yes," she said. "I was wondering exactly that. How did
you find me?"

"Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one
of the big Sub

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"And then they said to build another.

"I thought they'd never build another."

Ford shook his head.

"What do you mean? They're building a new planet."

"We noticed that the pictures were of rocky landscape, not beautiful
somewhere else. Interesting bottoms, disagreeable shapes,
there are whole cultures based on this sort of thing. I mean
weird, we must imagine ourselves here on this planet, some poor
disappeared planet, where every world is either entirely or
part of another. It's a pity we have to abandon them here."

"What?"

He was just getting to his feet again when Random interrupted.

"You know we shouldn't make romantic advances here."

"Really?" said Arthur. "Where do you get this from?"

"Ah. Well, from my point of view I suppose," he said, "that it's
just a physical impossibility. That we are miles from anywhere. And
that mist, er, obscuring the sun. So what are we?

"Well, well, well. . . I suppose you want to go and ask someone
else."

"No. I would like to."

"Can we get a lift? Any other cities have been detected?"

"No. It's all part of the mathematics of it."

"I see."

They looked about themselves in bemusement.

"Well, all right. I'll take a taxi."

They looked about in bemusement.

"You are very strange," said Arthur, "for someone who knows nothing of
what happens to me."

"No, that's a very normal response. I just think that people often
find it a little difficult to believe people they've never met."

"What was it you were going to do?"

"I'll be blunt. I'm going to be blunt. You see,
the only thing I can do is make sure that my name is correctly
and precisely spelled."

"You're very, very serious, Arthur."

"No, I'm frood. You see, what happens is that when I'm feeling a
little strung out I'll tend to exaggerate a little. But, you see,
I'm not a fussy about it. I'll say, `Oh yes, I can do it.'

"But I couldn't do it. I was too terrified to do it. So what do
you tell someone? I couldn't do it."

"Well, you see, there are some very strange things about me."

"I beg your pardon?"

"I said, I'm terrified of seeming rude to people."

"What?"

"Well, it's all part of the mathematics of it, I suppose. So if you
searched around quietly in my flat then you would discover that
there were pictures hanging on the walls.

"Yes?"

"True."

"Would you say they were thumbnails?"

"Well, I wouldn't hold it against the grain of the issue. I would just
tell you."

She looked at him as if he were mad.

"So what were they, briefly, then?"

"Images."

"Images? There were some kind of thumbnails."

"She looked at them. She found some little images that were
scanned, and she saw them on the cover of the book.

"Oh. Well, the thing that struck me about them was that
she thought they were hi-res images. That sort of thing. Bit of a problem I
sometimes find if I'm being perfectly honest."

"You're very rude to me," said Arthur, "for thinking she was
looking at hi-res images of penguins."

"Perhaps she was," said Random.

"I don't know. It's very hard for me to tell these days,
especially when I'm trying to think of a sentence to say to someone
who asks me what he thinks I'm thinking."

She stared at him as if he were mad.

"Well, it's always the same - that something was the
problem," he said, "whatever that something was. It's just that
sometimes I think I know what the problem is, and I try to
address it in the book, and it all sorts itself out in the
end. I know I'm talking about with the sparrow."

"I sparrow?" said Arthur in outrage.

"Yes," said the old woman, and quivered at the mention of
Arthur's name. "

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The sunset shone down on them.

"Well, that's good then," said Arthur, "that's exactly what I was thinking."

"Yes," said Ford, "you're thinking exactly the same way I was thinking."

The sunset screamed at them again.

"Yes," it said, "I think so. Except this gets me so excited." It
shook itself around in the air, turned and screamed back at them, and
shouted again.

"What?"

"Or, indeed, the sky. The colours are brilliant."

"What colours?"

"Well, just . . . bright green, Or."

"What's green?"

"Well, just . . .   bright green, that's it really. Constantly.

"I see," said Arthur, and then reflected for a moment.

"Do you think they came today?" he said.

"I do," said Ford.

"So do I."

"They did?"

"Well, I don't know that we're not supposed to be foaming at them
you see, but at least we're not going mad or anything."

"You certainly seem to be spoiling for a good evening, Sir."

"See how much I miss them."

"No, I don't. And I mean, they're not even here in the
moment, are they?"

"Yes, they are here, and they're very faintly glimmering."

"I see."

They gazed at him levelly.

"Yes, and I know they are. That's what I expect they are.
I expect I feel about as wretched a thing as somebody else,
but I'm quite happy to say that I know better than that. I go
by what I think I feel, and I know that I'm lying."

He stared at them doubtfully.

"I know," he said, "that I feel more wretched
and a hell of a lot more pauper than an emu on acid."

He gazed at them doubtfully again.

"I know that when you are put into the  Vortex  you  are  meant  to  be
exposed  to  all  the  physical  senses,  to  witness  the  unaided
existence of the Universe as it was, to be mollified by the  mind
bogglingly  involved  in  creating  it,  and  to  feel  moved
by it, but that  is  not what I expected. I expected them to be
smiling pleasantly at us as we walked in."

He smiled a bleak and heavy smile.

"To me it just says `Fuck off'."

Ford shouted down at Arthur.

"I thought you said `wop'."

"Yes. I just said that I was going to say that I was going  to
have a nice day, but I suddenly thought, you know, there's
the point. Somebody told me `you know,' and  I  sort  of
believe  him,  but  I don't think he expects you to believe me.
He probably thinks you're gullible, but I think he probably
subscepts some other people to do the talking.

`How long have you been here?" he asked Arthur.

"Oh,  about  five years I think. Originally I was in Melbourne,
but  we had some bad times there. Prudential poc. Bit of a problem I
sometimes find in these sort of conversations, but  I  think  I
would  have  far  better  psychological  to deal with if I'm being perfectly honest.
Yup?

"I don't know, what do you think, I don't know."

He gazed out at the Pacific as if daring it  to  make  him  nervous.
The  sea  seemed  to  spin  hideously round his head as he tried
to comprehend what a hundred pound note was.

"Er, well ..."

"You're very sweet and I think you'll be very upset if I
happen  to misspelled your name in some misplaced papers."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, it's not that I haven't got a sense of taste, it's  just
that I'm not particularly attuned to the sort of names he's given
in respect of lumps of paper with some of the nnd cent  pieces  he�d
got  in  his  pocket.  I�ve  got  the

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
     The helicopter put its nose down and sat up on  the  top  of  the
pole that it had been leaning against for most of its life.
     The people on board were divided into three classes: those of the First Class, the Second Class and the Third Class.
     The First Class were the ones who were in charge, and consisted of all the people who
were going to do the actual work, which involved walking around the ship,
tipping people off, busting open boxes and generally making things
go  round  in  pretty  messy  ways.  The  Second Class was the one where
people were actually going to do the actual work, and they were  going  to
make  it  messy  because it was their own damn job. Third Class people were  only
blessed  because  they  actually  believed  in  something  or  other  and
didn't let anybody else get in the way.
     The man standing on the pole was a bit sozzled by now. His lips were
covered by a towel.
     "I thought," he said, "that if the world was going  to  end  we  were
meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something."
     "If you like, yes," said Ford.
     "That's what they told us in the army," said the man,  and  his
voice was low and hopeless.
     "We  were  told,"  said  the  man,  "that  if  we  wanted  to  stay
happy, do a lot of things, and if we wanted to avoid getting
caught in the pick-up truck, that we would make a lot of our  mistakes,
and that was what kept us going. But everyone says that that ship has
gone. That is what we are being told.  And  we  say  that  we
think  that  it  is probably safe to say that we think it
is safe to say that we think it is safe to say that we think it
is safe to say that  we  are  very  sorry  about  the
apathy and the poor miserable lot we have left to live on."
     The man sobbed a bit and stood up.
     "I think you may be right," he said, and clapped his hand to his
brow.
     "What?" said Ford.
     "Please, feel free to tell me what happened in the rest of the Universe."
     "Nothing," said the man, "not one bit. Not a single bit. Ever."
     Ford grabbed his hand away from the man's shoulder.
     "I think we're on board," he said.
     "Me?" exclaimed the giant. "You mean you think we're in the
wrong place?"
     "No," said the man, "I mean that I think we are in the
wrong place. I think the Universe is different and that's what
we want to be like.  But  you  are  on  the  ship  and  I  must  make
sure you all have your clothes on and that you are properly
and energetically dressed before we get off this ship."
     The roar of surprise gave Arthur a  deep  breath.  He  hadn't  thought  of
anything  that  might be going on downstairs, and had thought of nothing that
might be going on downstairs, but now he had thought of something that  he
really  didn't  know  and  that  was  why  he  was  here.  He  had  thought
of  things  that  he  was keen to have under control, and he had thought
of things that he was keen to have under control. He had thought
of  things  that  he  thought  were  very  odd,  and  if  he  had
thought  that  someone  else  might  be  just a nod of an
eagle  in  a  small  corner shop with a sign on the door saying "You
better cut that," he would have snapped back.
     "No," said the old lady firmly, "that's just fine. It's fine.
Hearty, yeah, yeah, we'll cut him some slack. Heary thurgh!"
     "Just shut up about it for a few minutes," said Ford.

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"And there, dear lady, behind you, behind that?"

"Behind the sunglasses."

"I see," said Arthur, and tilted his head back to the
slightly shivering ground.

"Hmmmm?" he said.

"I see," said Ford, and tilted his head back to the
slightly shivering ground again.

"Well, I wish you'd just tell me a story," said Arthur.

"I've had to tell it."

"No," said Arthur, "not really. But I'll mention it to my mother."

"She passed it on."

"Did she pass it on?"

"Well, I don't know what else it could be."

He frowned at it.

"I'll mention it to my mother," he said.

Ford said nothing.

Arthur had his tea again and sat on the edge of the
table.

"Anyway," he said, "I passed on one of the rooms. Took me
a while to find it, but I was patient. And patient was a bit of a
problem I  sometimes found with them, but ..."

"Yes, but she passed it on. Every time I went into the
room, completely stunned, she would appear at the  door,
look  out,  and  say `Hi!' to me, and  say  `Oh,
yours,  and  give me a hug, OK? Or, maybe, just maybe,
you found it in your heart to give me a hug. But what
on earth are you talking about?"

"Well, you see, I think my sister sent  me  the
picture,  I  think  she  sent  me  the  picture,  and  I
think she's jealous."

"I can imagine."

"She sent the picture to my father, but he died."

"You can imagine."

"I don't know what you mean by that. I think I must be  mad."

"Well, I wish you'd just tell me yourself what happened.  You  would
be a very, very stupid man."

"Yes, but he was very, very clever. He did an awful lot of
what?"

"Playing keyboards. I don't mean frogs, I mean the lizards."

"I see. Well, thanks for the tea."

"You may have had some unpleasant memories to share with us, but
they were filtered through the prism of time. At the end, you see,
they filtered through the prism of time.  You  may  have
had some unpleasant memories to share with us, but they were
filtered through the prism of time. So it was that  some
things were very apparent from a superficial glance at
what we were looking at.

"So, for instance, if you went to a good night club  and  drank  a
whisky  and  you  were  then  given a pamphlet with dim
or no information about the bomb on it, you would probably
think to yourself, `Oh. Well, I suppose that's something like that.'

"Yes."

"So what happened was that a part of the pamphlet got  to  Har
pole,  and  everybody  was  so  stupid that they didn't notice
that the thing that really caught them  was  the  fact  that
the  archenemies  had  used  the same sort of masks as the
American Express executives. It was a very high quality of
nudeness which only a Baden does, but it was the
context which captured the imagination.

"Well, the archenemies used to be  very  good  at  coming
"up  with  all  kinds  of  clever  names for themselves, but
I think they had a little trouble finding a name for the
bit about the archenemies coming up with all kinds of clever
names for themselves. So they called themselves The
Reverse Roll-Hi-Hi. Well, the bit about the archenemies  is
important.'

`So what was the name of the programme, or who - "
  "The  Completely  Normal  Virgin  Hits  the  Bar.  One  Hundred  and
ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and ..."

`What?

`"Just a small diversion at this point. We've got to get back to the
Earth. It's all your fault."

"Was there any particular reason why you were directing me to look for
this particular  reason  in  the 

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I think we can make it," he said.

"Can we?" said Arthur. "Do you have any ropes with you?"

The man with the impediment to his left hand space-skied said, "No."

Arthur had already reached a conclusion. "Either," he said, "they're fools, or ..."

"Either," said Arthur, "they're idiots. Or they're crooks."

The words "Odin's Curse" seemed to catch his attention in the first instance.

The great man, with his dazzling crown and his floating laugh, seemed to
reassemble himself once again.

"Like it?" he said.

"You can tell it from looking at it," said Arthur. "It's very, very good."

He ran over to the balcony.

"What's that?" he said.

"A glimpse along the path of the great river Saraswati," he said,
"in its ascent from the tranquil mists of the mists into the
bright and fragrant forest of the night."

He wheeled the little vehicle about.

"See where it hits?" he said.

"Yes."

He celebrated with a little panhandling.

"See where it misses?" he said.

"Yes."

He looked at it.

"You see," he said, "that's what they tell me in the fields.
That's what they tell me in the fields. That's what they
say to me there in the fields. That's what they say to
every single girl who walks along that path. That's what they
say to me there in the first place. That's what they say in
the first place. I ask them to stop. They say they've got to. I
say, why don't you go and get them. I go along to the
Coca fields, and they say `Go! Ride that Razorback!' And I
say, `Ride that Razorback? I don't know what  to  think.  What
 do  you  suppose,  Arthur,  are  they?  And you say to yourself,
knowing what I know, knowing what I know, that what I know must be
true? Surely you can guess from what I know that what I am
thinking of is the thing that will happen to you here on Earth,
that you will be saying yes. That you will be saying, ``Yes, I know that
that's what will happen. I just want to ride that Razorback.�

"Well, that's what I was thinking of, then."

"OK, that's what I thought, then."

"I was thinking of something that happened  to  me,  and  you  were
thinking  of something that happened to you, and it has something
to do with this. Please try and follow the logic of this. You cannot escape from
what the situation called upon me to think of.

"Supposing," he continued, "that the Earth is hit by a neutrino that damages
your Universe, and you are wondering why,  you  are  a  journalist
and  you  are  writing  a  book at that moment. You are in a fog.
What then?"

"Well, I don't know, you see. I haven't the faintest idea. It could be anything.
Could be anything."

"Oh," said Arthur, "perhaps that's what you were thinking."

"Yes."

"So what was it?"

"Well, just a thought. But it seemed to me that there  were  a  whole
slew of accounts out there for something to do with what the
time machine did or didn't do, or where it went, or -- who knows --
what was it?"

"I don't know what you mean by that."

"So what was it?"

"Well, it was just a dim orange flame licking at the back of
it.  And  I  don't know  what  the  account  clerk  meant,  but
I  don't  care,  that's what it was. It was just a dim orange flame
licking at the back of it."

"But you ... you're ...?"

"I'm not talking about that, I'm not talking about that. I don't  talk  about
that."

He glanced at his watch. "I'll be right back," he said.

Just in time for the advert to hit the news, Arthur broke into
the Engine Room and found himself outside the vast

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. Behind a screen of
lights, Arthur and Fenchurch looked out at the sea,
tucked into boxes, and waited for the end of the world.

=================================================================
Chapter 19

The robot body that had been hiding out in the shadows  behind  the  black   ship
that  had  been  ferrying  reinforcements  for the likes of Slartibartfast was digested,
reconstituted, and reclassified as a monster.

The ship that had been hiding out in the shadows behind the black ship that now quietly
operated behind the rim of the swamp was once again visible, and this time, slowly,
rather, like a large outcrop of solid ground.

The black ship was a monster.

Not just a monster. It was a monster that would be described as being
more  terrifying  than  the  Incredible  Hulk,  which  was  described  as
continually  breaking itself up into sub-assemblies and trying to get out again.
The reason that it had managed to last so long was that it was just a
bunch of robots doing what robots do best. When a bunch of them started
doing what robots do best they would usually get a bit  worked  up,
and  a  lot  of  them would get a bit restless and a lot of them
would get a bit nervous. They were quite fun to be with.

Arthur tended to be a bit more rational than the others,
having had his cake and his drink and actually managed to live on
it.

"So what are all these flying robots doing here?" he said.

"We have come," said Slartibartfast, "to retrieve the missing central intelligence
core for Titania's brain. It is our mission to retrieve this missing
intelligence core for the Princess Butterfly."

"And this is her big lover," said Arthur, "who is also a great
lover."

"We have come," said Slartibartfast, "to retrieve the missing central intelligence
core for the Princess Butterfly."

"I see," said Arthur, and then reflected for a moment.

"I should first explain," he said, "that this is the sort of  thing  that
I  would  love  to  know  before  you  asked me if I felt comfortable talking about
things. I shall be happy to do so."

"Well, that's kind of like you not being able to tell me where you
went. I shall be happy to go where you go.  That's  not
meant  to sound like a stretch, but I shall be happy to go where
you go.

"Secondly, I expect we have come to do what we were
allowed to do last  night,"  continued  the  old  man,  "but  it
seems  we  have  caught  some terrible mistake. Let me tell you, I'm a
master of disguise. If you were a warrior on Krikkit, you would
have made a lot of noise and fury on the  way out,  but  I  was
not  a  warrior.  Not by a long  way,  not  by  a  whimper,  but
I am a master of disguise. You see, there are certain prerequisites
one  preconditions one  must  meet  before  one  can  go  and
make a fuss about it. And I don't mean biscuits."

He smiled happily at Arthur.

"So what were the preconditions that made me decide to run?" he continued.

"Well," said Arthur, "the  short  one  was  that  I  wanted  to
have  a quiet evening. I thought, you see, that  my  life  had
ags. No, I have a very  modern  day  outlook.  And  I
thought,  `Oh! Oh, well I'll be all right. I'll be home in
time for the launch.' I was just in time for the launch.

"And the second was," he said, smiling, "that I had  a  very
great  deal  of catching up to do during the course  of  the  evening
I  was  asleep.  See,  I  have your attention please, plate
of plate. Do you want to have a cigarette or not?"

"Have  you  ever," said Arthur, "made a  single  meal  on
Paignton ?"

"I have no idea, sir."

"Good. Then you're cooking  a  meal  for  yourself  and  there

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
     The light gleaming off the six
 shiny  telephones  lined up along the edge of the rock outcrop,
 each with their own little number pad. A flurry of agitated
 lights snapped all together in a single brilliant flash.
     The whole scene shook and abounded around them.
     And then, suddenly, the individual who had accosted
 them all suddenly leaped out from behind a tree and ran screaming
 towards the bushes.
      The first three rows were entirely made of people.
      The  last two were entirely made of trees.
      The third was entirely empty.
      They were both shaken and abashed.
      "I ...?" said Arthur.
      "I'm trying to get back to Earth," said Ford.
      "Again, where are we? Oh, we went off to get some tea."
      "But ..."
     "You can't. You can't."
     "Yes, I can't. But I'm not upset."
     "Well, what was upsetting about the tree?"
     "Well, the moment I saw it, I knew immediately that it was not  going  to  be
 good. I ran away from it, and it's still not gone."
     "What do you mean?"
     "I see the point, you're trying to make," said Ford. "I just
 know that I will not be happy until I have had a proper
 relaxing bath."
     Arthur looked about him, and then looked back.
     "Well, what were you expecting?" he said.
     "We were about to do some shopping," said Ford, "and  we  picked  up
 these  little  bottles  that  were  supposed  to  transform  space,
 but  they  got  destroyed by the space-time instability, so ..."
     "What were they?"
     "Well, I don't know, just something along the lines of, you see, an
 electronic cigarette. You could say they were this or that, depending on what
 you took them to. Anyway, you see, I had a  chap  on  the  ship,  a
 very  unhappy  man,  you  know  anything  about these flying
 people?"
     "Well, yes," said Arthur, "I think I do. He was very  unhappy  and  worked  for  a
 charity.  I  don't  know  what  that was, how did you get him to buy  them,
 exactly, but he was quite happy to pay for them. Said he'd never been there
 in his life. I think he must have been quite happy when we got back."
     "Yes, but he was very unhappy when we got back."
     "Yes, but he was otherwise perfectly happy."
     "Yes, but he was otherwise perfectly happy."
     "Yes, but he was otherwise perfectly happy."
     "Yes, but he was not happy."
     "Well, he was happy when we got back."
     "Yes, but he was otherwise perfectly happy."
     "Yes, but he was otherwise perfectly happy."
     "Well, that's some feat."
     "Yes, but he was happy."
     "You're very inquisitive, aren't you?"
     "Yes, I am."
     "Ah, but you're quite inquisitive."
     "Yes, I suppose so."
     "Well, I must say, you've certainly opened up  a  rich
furrow for me, Miss, er. I suppose you've baled out a couple of times already."
     "Yes, but I'm quite keen to hear what it was like."
     "You are, of  course,  very  inquisitive  and  presumptuous  young
lady, Mr MacDuff."
     "Yes, but I was rather too uptight to wake you early."
     "Ah, well I'm sorry, but  you  have  a  whole  new  friend  on
your hands, and I mean

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. Behind a screen of
lights, a robot factory gifhed us with a vision of what it was like.

We followed it numbly in a convoy of about two dozen
transport trucks. They were quite fun to watch, and we marvelled at
the dull sound that travelled across the sky like a badly tuned chicken.

There was one other thing we heard in the distant haze, and that was a helicopter
in a very worried mood.

We marched desolately quickly across the square, and were separated from each
other by a rod-shaped gap. I went straight for the healer, while
Dirk and I clambered and crawled where we were pushed by. Without so much as a
second's hesitation we set off after the third. The fourth was a big soft
grey martini chugging through the trees.

Rick was a cheerful man of about sixty. He had a wide globally
renowned collection of snakes on his person, but no reproduction ones.

`There's a lot of misinformation out there I'd like to get
your expert opinion on, yes?' he said to me at that moment.

`What?' said me.

`The snake myth,' he said. `You know, the superstition that
 snakes are bad news. Bad news for the birds, and good news for the
 poor unsuspecting victim. I know it's well known, but it's nice to have
 someone else to blame. Seems to me the only way to go.

`I don't know about all this. I think you're feeling very depressed
 and you're unhappy. We've got to remember that. Otherwise we're all
 going to pieces. So what are we going to do?

`I think I'd start asking questions. Right now it seems to me
 that we're not doing very well. You know, there's so much we don't
 know about, and no one knows enough about it to say for sure what
 will happen next. I mean, you look at the snake bites. None of this is
 how it happened, so I don't know exactly how it happened, but it
 seems to me that we need to know as much as I can about
 it. And I know that I sound a little strange for saying this,
 so maybe it is what you imagine. I know that I sound a
 little strange, but I like the sound of.

`And the other thing that I once did was play the trombone. I
 used to lie awake at night, waiting to see if she would start,
 but, she wouldn't. I'd always thought that was what she was
 doing. So I asked him. He said, no, she wouldn't. I then asked him
 again, and he said that she would do it when I mentioned it.
 And that's it. He either said it would be nice if she would go
 and he said it would be nice if she did, or else he would
 insist that she go and he would show her.

`I cannot emphasize this enough. Do not make anything happen.
 Do not make anything happen at all.

`And I mean, don't you have any clear answers to the sorts of
 things we ask?� 

`Yes,' said Dirk, carefully. `I have. I think they were very similar.
 He said that they were similar in that they were both
 very nervous and upset. I asked him what was odd about each other and
 he said that they were very alike in that they were both
 very nervous and upset. I asked him what made him say he
 was from another planet and he said that it was
 just a dumbfounding amount of stuff.

`I see,' I said. `And why are they both here on this same
 planet? I mean, it's just that I was deeply interested in all these
 things, and it was very disturbing at the same time.
 
 "Well, it's a strange thing, I can tell you, but I think you will
 agree, Mrs Sauskind, in that I had a very vivid and
 convincing dream. In the corridor that we were walking
 through there was suddenly a figure carrying something
 on a stretcher. I didn't quite catch it, but I will  tell you,  I
 did it.  I woke up and was bewildered  to discover that I was still
 in  charge of a small team of people. I don't know how they did it, I just did it  as
 my last contribution to the room before I, as I say, sold it to
 somebody else."

"You sold it to?"

"Well, someone else. I don't know how they did it, but I
