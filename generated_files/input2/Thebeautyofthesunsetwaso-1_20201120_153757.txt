-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.  The building itself was invisible, as it burned in the sun, a continuous blaze of vivid colors.  It would have been impossible to tell that the light was artificial, or that it came from outside.  The shadows of the cranes, however, were real:  they reflected light as well as reflected it. 
The scene was repeated, over and over again, in the Monastery of Sainte-Mre.  It is difficult to convey the beauty of it, and the beauty of the scene is intensified through comparisons of details.  For example, the detail of the rood screens and the little room that opens the room; the vast chandeliers; the prayer wheels and lamp, the stained-glass windows, the yellow, honeycomb of gables and cupolas.  These details alone make up the exquisite detail of the scene; nothing more is added. 
If the camera has been made from a single negative negative film, it is difficult to tell how real and how impressionable the image of the Monastery of Sainte-Mre may be, but it is clear that the sunlit ruins of the ancient monastery is not all that different from any other in the world.  What more do you find here that is in contrast to the stupendous opulence of the monastery? 
The Monastery of Sainte-Mre is a work of art.  It is a vast, eerie structure, much like the vast doors and towers of some other monastery.  The monks stand in small, open spaces in the great caverns of the Cathedral, which rise above the main building.  The monastic towers are towered around the central core, and the lower levels are the cloisters.  The central building itself rises five stories above the main building. 
About the walls of the main building, over the centuries, are the white-painted, gaily painted murals of St. Catherine, the Virgin, and the Virgin of the Chateaux.  The massive doors, supported by six series of wooden frames, let in light and air.  The windows, which let in nearly 360 degrees of Sun, are illuminated from above, with long shadows, which are extremely rare in this cold, airless world.  The walls are mostly stone, which is a regular part of the structure, and are covered with pictures. 
The entire monastery is surrounded by a ring of twenty acres of ancient, graffiti-ridden walls.  The square, with its mazes of jagged, angled, and asymmetrical wall formations, is larger than the town.  The monastery and the town, though much smaller, come to be a single whole.  They stand side by side in this world, and in this world they are parts of each other, like the ruins of an abandoned town. 
The painting in the square, representing St. Catherine, is by Georges Roed, the servitor of the Little Doctor.  The woman who falls in love with her, a sister of St. Catherine, is painted by Maria Beaumont-Eddy. 
In the vast church of the Monastery of Sainte-Mre, the enormous stone bridge, with its massive tomb and black-curiosity statue, its effigy of St. Catherine, and the Virgin, is there a strange thing.  It is as if the artist had himself become caught in a trance, and the figures that he depicts, and the images of them, were the imagination of a second-person story by an author who was a very uncultured one. 
There are, of course, the St. Catherine statue and the Virgin, and also the vast black church, and the churchward ceiling, and the vast, gently curving ceiling of the church.  These are the monuments of Saint Catherine and St. Catherine, preserved in the beauty of the centuries. 
As they approach, a halo of light materializes from the square, and a gazette, which is always there, rises from its pedestal in front of Saint Catherine.  The light is illuminating a statue within a statue, which is alone, with no human assistance, and has the Virgin's arms around it. 
The picture is a very interesting one, and one which is very difficult to grasp.  First, it is simple and obvious:  The square is the church, the church stands on the square, and the central square is the Cathedral.  The halo is another halo, and the saint, St. Catherine, the Virgin, is standing on top of a statue of St. Catherine in the centre of the square. 
Second, it is impossible to grasp this all at once, and you are left with a sort of confused mote of uncertainty, which he, the Virgin, had described almost exactly a few minutes earlier. 
The halo is herself,

“You know, this place is a little zoo.”

“Mm,” she said. “I guess.”

I pulled a photograph from my bag and handed it to her. The scene was exactly as I’d left it. I could see the ocean, the boats. There was a park, a tranquil lake. A big cat. A young girl sitting on a bench, in a park.

“A cicada?”

“A big one.”

“How big?”

“A CICADA.”

“You like it?”

“How should I know?”

“You like it?”

“I guess so. I really couldn’t say for sure.”

“Anyhow, it’s beautiful. The sunlight’s beautiful, the wind’s beautiful, the sea’s …”

“The sea’s in bloom?”

“The sea’s in bloom. And the birds’ hooting birds.”

“Do you know a CICADA?”

“No, I don’t.”

“I do.”

“A CICADA?”

“It’s just what I’m going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to go to be go to go to go to go to go to see an old CICADA.”

“Oh, really?”

“You know, that’s what it means.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“Anyway, I like it.”

“So you think I like it?”

“Sure.”

She looked at me in a funny way. “You know what I think is, that’s what I think is.”

I nodded.

“You think I’m a liar?”

“No, you’re right.”

“Forget it. I’m not lying. I’m just thinking that this is a little more of a psychological issue than anything else.”

“You’re right,” I said.

She gave a little shrug.

“I’m glad I could see you,” she said.

“You’re welcome.”

“I’m always welcome.”

“I know that,” I said. “But you’ve got to be nice.”

“Nice?”

“You’re right.”

She gave a little shrug again.

“I think that’s enough for today. Let’s go back to the day after tomorrow. You said it.”

She looked at me in a funny way again. “You think so?”

“Sure,” I said. “But it’s not that easy being sweet. You know, I mean, I’m not that good.”

She laughed. “Well, I guess not. I guess not.”

“No, I’m sure you’ll be nice.”

“Like you say.”

We left the park and went into a small diner near the mall. The food was good, and she had a nice salad. I had some orange juice and a coffee. The place was a little noisy, and we ordered coffees. We ate for a few minutes, then she took a paper out of her bag and flipped it on the table.

“What was that all about?” she asked.

“A letter.”

“A letter?”

“Yeah. I forgot to mention that.”

She folded the paper and looked up at the ceiling.

“A long letter.”

“A long letter?”

“Yes.”

She frowned. “What does it say?”

“It just says, ‘Dear John.

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

The king’s Royal Guard, dressed in noble clothes, marched in, perfectly dressed, to protect the princess from the claws of the enemy. The king’s Royal Guard protected the princess from the claws of the enemy, which were ceaselessly gliding toward her, menacingly.

The king’s Royal Guard had no idea that the girl was being drawn by the same claw as her father. No one understood this. The girl’s father, though, was obviously the real royal girl. No one knew this, but the king’s Royal Guard’s presence was a certain comfort to her. The girl felt it, deep inside her body.

The king’s Royal Guard was now gazing at the princess with an odd gaze. The one who had carried the tray of food to the chair in the waiting room was also gazing at the princess. He did not notice the gaze of the king’s Royal Guard until the girl was at least a few steps away. Then he turned to face the king.

“I don’t see anything,” the girl said in a frightened voice.

The king turned to her. “You must not fear. The moment one of these clawed paws has your body, it will come for you. Only the king is strong enough to stand against such claws.”

“But I’m not weak,” the girl said. “I can move. I’ve got strength. I can do a good deal of moving.”

The king smiled. “You’ve got a strong will,” he said. “And strong legs. You’ve got guts.”

“I have a terrible conscience,” the girl said.

The king’s Royal Guard was gazing intently at her. It was clearly not the kind of gaze a man would be comfortable in.

“I have a terrible conscience,” the girl said again. “It’s a dark one, but it hurts. I feel it through my body. Sometimes I have to pee.”

The royal guard did not seem to be paying any attention. He was gazing at the girl with an expressionless gaze.

“You have had much experience,” the king said. “You know how to deal with it. You know how to use it.”

“I have a terrible conscience,” the girl said.

The king nodded.

The girl shuddered.

“How does it feel?” the king asked.

“It hurts,” the girl said.

“I see,” the king said. “You have dealt with it well enough. You have dealt with it well enough.”

The girl was silent.

The king continued staring at the girl. “But what is the cause of your having such a terrible conscience?”

“I have a terrible conscience,” the girl said again.

The king slowly turned his gaze to her, as if gauging her with his eyes. “What do you have with such a terrible conscience?”

“I have no conscience,” she said.

The king’s gaze slid away from her, and he set his gaze on the road. She shrank back, frightened.

“You don’t have a conscience,” the king said. “You’re a young girl and a beauty. You’re not a devil. If you had a conscience, you would be a great devil. What is your connection with the devil?”

“I have no conscience,” she said again.

The king’s gaze slid away, as if it had been withdrawn. His gaze went to the road again. She sat very still, staring at the road.

“You don’t have a conscience,” the king said again.

“No, I have no conscience,” she said.

“But you have no wish to live,” the king said.

“No, I don’t,” the girl said.

“You don’t have any wish to die,” the king said. “No, you don’t. You’re not a devil or a god or a Buddha, you’re a lovely girl, very pretty, and very happy.”

“I don’t know,” the girl said.

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
    The sun sinks on the cliff here at the foot of the precipitous drop. The dim purple glare from the furnaces of Caladan and the clean flatlands beyond are lost to sight. The galaxy is a cheery blue in the sultry air.
    The cliffside is sprawled with the bulky cargo ships. 
    We've got a deal! Jessica thought.
    The cargo ships were anchored there, and their decks and berths were covered by the sloping rock. Ships belonging to the Guild were on the beach, and two were undamaged. The still-sullen cargo ships were not opened. There were no signs of life about them. The seawater scum that slopped over the surface was wet, and the fresh air smelled of the sea and the chemicals in their tanks.
    Paul turned toward the hazy bulk of the Guild ships. He looked to his left where Harkonnen guards stood at attention, and he felt a pang of regret for his hatred of them.
    "The Harkonnens have lost," he said. "They're lost because the Guild is crippled. They're crippled and scattered like dust, and some are on the beach where we are -- mounds of dunes and canals and sand. All the Harkonnen ships are in the deep. They'll sink in and drown."
    The guards stood at attention, looking at Paul, who stood with his back to them, staring down at the sands. 
    "The Guild," he said. "The Guild! We have nothing to trade but the Guild. We have nothing but the Guild!" 
    "The Guild," she whispered. "The Guild will save us. It has to save us."
    "No," he said. "The Guild has only a few things, but it can take care of itself. It can send ships to kill us and take our spice, or it can send ships to destroy us and take our spice. The Guild has not yet developed weapons like the spice-spoil carrier. It has not yet perfected energy weaponry." 
    "What's this weapon you speak of?" she asked.
    "A device of destruction," he said. "A laser beam. It can slice the flesh of a man. Its effect can be reversible. It can drive a Guild ship away."
    "You have no doubt of that?"
    "I have my reasons for bringing them forward," he said. "My reasons are valid."
    She felt herself redden, touched by his gravity, his lack of expression, his power. He spoke in a soft voice: "You have no fear of death."
    "I have a right to die," she said. "Death is the ultimate outcome of folly." 
    "You're not in mortal danger," he said. "It's the process of the universe."
    "I've had the illusion that I live," she said. "I thought I lived, that I was the thing I was going to become. But that illusion passed. What is that thing I'm going to become?" 
    "The ultimate fate of the universe," he said. "It's what we most fear, the ultimate fate that our lives prolong." 
    "What if I were?" she asked.
    "The thing that you are," he said. "What if you were like the Fremen, accustomed to live in unimaginable poverty and in a land where they have no tradition of government, where all their members live on charity? What would you do then? You could escape into the desert. You could live by yourself in secret. You could lie down in a cave and pray for the spice." 
    "Lies down in caves," she said.
    "I don't like caves," he said. "I can't go to them." 
    "Then I'll go," she said.
    "No!" he said. "You can't go back to them. You can't go back to the Harkonnen caves. You can never go there. You have a doom you have not yet defined. You'll pay for that death, though, and you'll live."
    "But I'd save my life," she said. "I'll save you." 
    "You are the most attractive of people I've ever met," he said.
    "Perhaps."
    "No! You'll stay with me. You're a man I can trust. You'll be safe there. There'll be a

"We have no need for them," she said. "The cab will pick us up."

"Then let's get out of this," he said. "It's not a cab."

"If we get out of this," she said, "we'll have to stay here."

"If we get out of this," he said, "we'll have to get out of here."

"Yes, we'll get out of this." She nodded. "I'll drive you to the nearest town."

"It's a little town. The cab will take us there."

"Yes, I know." She smiled again. "I'll drive you."

He watched her drive off. He could feel the vibration of the wheels under his feet. The girl, naked, topless, in her brown leather skirt and stockings, sitting in the seat beside him.

When they reached the town, they turned right. The boy's father had a headache, but that could not be helped. He would get some sleep.

As they turned the first corner, Lidia jumped out of the cab. She was wearing nothing underneath. Her legs were bare. She looked like a girl who had slept on a mat before the fire. Her body seemed very clean.

"You're not the woman I wanted," he said.

"No," she said. "I'm not. I don't belong here."

"You are not the woman I wanted," he said.

She laughed.

"No," she said.

"No," he said.

She laughed, and moved away from the seat. "I'm not the woman I wanted," she said. "I don't belong anywhere else."

"That's a big difference," he said.

"No, I'm not," she said. "You made me. I was ready to be a big woman, but I didn't want to be a woman."

"I don't care if you're not a woman or not," he said.

"You're the only one I want to be," she said, and moved away from the seat.

She did not look back.

"Did you tell me that I could have a daughter?" he asked.

"Yes, I told you that," she said.

"What a dumb question," he said.

"Don't you want to know?"

"No."

"Why not?"

"Because I don't know," she said, and sat down once more in the seat.

"Because you don't know," he said.

"You can't know," she said. "Because I have no knowledge."

She stared at him with eyes that were not smiley. "Because I have no knowledge of you."

"But you have knowledge of yourself," he said. "You know what you are. You know who you are. I don't know how I know. I don't know what I should do."

"You want to know how I don't know?"

"That's right," he said.

"Because you know me," she said.

He nodded.

"I don't want to know you," she said.

"And I want to know you," he said.

"I don't want to know you at all," she said. "I want to know you better."

"Why?"

"Because," she said, "if you had your wisdom, if you had a marvelous knowledge of yourself, if you could judge yourself, you would know that I, who am merely a woman, don't even know who I am."

She thought. "But you are my brother."

"No," he said. "I'm your brother."

"I don't know you," she said.

"No," he said.

"Why not?"

"Because I don't."

She sat there, looking straight at him.

"I don't know you," she said.

He said nothing to that.

"I'll be good," she said. "I'll be good."

"You are a very good woman," he said.

"Yes," she said.

"You are a very good woman," he said.

"Yes."

"Your brother is very good," he said.

"Yes. He is very good," she said.

"How do I know about you?" he asked.

"Because you are my sister," she said.

"No," he said.

"You are my sister," she said. "

     A few minutes later the truck approached the hospital grounds. It stopped, doors opened, and the driver descended the ramp, looking straight at the two urchins. He looked right at them and smiled.
     "I'll bring you another one," he said.
     The man did not turn. "Just a second," he said, and moved toward the people, who were gathered around the van. They looked at him quite clearly.
     "Mr. Gumm," the woman said.
     "Miss Milch," he said. "This is Mr. Gumm. May I have the pleasure of shaking your hand?"
     "Certainly," Miss Milch said. "And I'm Miss Daisy Foster, of Philadelphia. How nice to meet you, Mr. Gumm."
     He said, "Nice to meet someone like you, Miss Milch."
     "I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Gumm," she said. "I've heard of you and your wife."
     He said, "I'm proud to meet you, Miss Milch."
     "How nice," she said. "I'm sure it's quite a pleasure to meet someone like you."
     He said, "You have seen a great deal of my wife."
     "We have," Miss Milch said. "We are very much in the same path."
     "Ah," he said, and thought, "It's so, I hope. I had not thought of it as something that had happened long ago."
     "And you are married, Mr. Gumm," Miss Milch said.
     "No," he said. "I am not."
     Miss Milch said, "As I said, Mr. Gumm. We are very much in the same path. And I hope to see her again. For she is a very remarkable lady. Her health is remarkable."
     "Thank you," he said. "Even Miss Milch, you have been so kind as to say that I have."
     "I'm sure," Miss Milch said. "But it is not wise to put off a wedding for the sake of a long, long time."
     "I am glad to hear it," he said.
     "You have a lovely wife," Miss Milch said.
     "Thank you," he said. "But I am not."
     "But you have," Miss Milch said.
     "Yes," he said.
     "As I said, Mr. Gumm." Miss Milch smiled, and said, "You have a lovely wife. She is very pretty and has been educated very well. But I do not think she is pretty. She is too sensitive. I have heard that she is very sensitive. It is a shame that you should marry a man like Mr. Gumm."
     "Mr. Gumm is a very interesting man," he said.
     "I don't want to talk about him," Miss Milch said. "It is not wise."
     "I'll talk about him," he said.
     "Thank you," Miss Milch said. "But I do not think it is wise. You are a very wonderful man, Mr. Gumm, and I do not think you are very handsome."
     "I'm not," he said. "But I do feel very much like him."
     Miss Milch rose to her feet. "Come into the sitting room," she said. "I have a bottle of whiskey and some ice."
     "And a glass," he said. He put his arm around her.
     "I do not drink," Miss Milch said. "Not for things like that."
     "I'll drink for you," he said.
     "No," she said. "Not for anything like that."
     He said, "I'll drink for you."
     She put her arm around him and laughed.
     "It is a foolish day," he said. "But you are very charming."
     "You are a very handsome man, Mr. Gumm," she said. "You always was a very handsome man."
     He said, "I'll sit here and read to her."

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

"I'm looking for a market for scrap," she said, climbing into the truck. "Not an industrial base." She held a package of cigarettes. "I'll give you a bargain. There's nothing in this end of town but old newspapers."

"No?" Rydell asked. "I don't want any sale."

"I've found something," Chevette said, shoving her bag in the back of the truck. She fumbled in her bag, coming up with a crumpled pack of cigarettes. "I want you to stick to this." Chevette stuck to the pack, trying to light up, but Rydell stuck his hand in the pocket where the pack had been. "I found a newspaper," Chevette said. "It's the Times. You'll find it."

Rydell stuck his hand in the pocket of her bag and found the newspaper. It was a paper with an enormous photo of a gold fountain. "Hey," Chevette said, "I'm getting a picture of you right now." She turned to Rydell, exposing her right arm, crooked and casting serious shadow, in the light from the street. "I'm in a diner," she said, "and the owner's got a gun."

"The gun?"

"With a big smile, right?" She blew smoke. "I put a muzzle in my mouth and let it out."

"You're not serious?" He took the cigarette from her mouth. "You're smoking, are you?"

"No." She shook her head.

"That's what I thought," Rydell said, stuffing the cigarette into his pocket. "That's why I'm here."

"Where?"

"Goddamn," he said. "What did you say?"

"I was looking for a cover," Chevette said. "A section of floor."

"I thought you said somebody was here, up here."

"No," Chevette said, "but I thought somebody was. Just imagine getting this close, and I thought I saw it." She gestured, as if to the street. "It's not really there, is it?"

"It's everywhere," Rydell said. "Where there's light."

"It's everywhere," Chevette said. "It's everywhere."

Rydell watched her put her cigarette away. "I thought you said it was all rubble."

"A little boy says it's all gravel."

"A little boy says there's a story about that up there," Chevette said. "A woman thinks it's all old. I thought it was a fake up there, because I never went up there. I thought it was something she made herself."

"How big is that thing, up there?"

"Three stories. And there's somebody else up here, and I can't see any more."

"It doesn't look like you've made a walk in the past," Rydell said, "you see?"

"No," she said, "it just feels like someone's pushing me. I don't know who. I can see some people in a way, but I can't see anything. It's just like that camera thing, right?" She looked up at him. "I can get on with my thing, because I can see it, but it's not like I'm wearing a skeleton."

"A skeleton?"

"A skeleton. Or a statue. I can get on with my thing, but it's not like I'm wearing anything. You don't see skeletons around here, do you? It's like I was in the streets, once. I used to be a reporter, before I worked, and I used to see stories about things I never saw. A lot of them were down in those stories, you know? Most of them were nice, just what I saw. Not like that one. You can see it, up here." She pointed, in the direction of the bridge. "I used to watch that. But not now. It's just...  saying what it said. It said somebody's up here was asking for a cover. A city record, you know?"

"Sure," Rydell said, "we're on it. I mean, it sure as hell didn't have to tell us anything, right?"

"But they do," Chevette said, "they do. They told us, I guess."

"But they can't," Rydell said. "They can only tell us when it's time to."

"But they can only tell us what we want to know," Chevette said, "if we want to ask them. And they can't just tell us whether it

"Do you know," Colin said, turning his face to the sunset, "I'm in love with her.  I think we're in love.  Is that the kind of thing you're after?" 
"No," Dunworthy said. 
"It's kind of nice to think you're in love with her," Colin said. 
"I'm not in love with her." 
"I thought you were.  Is that it?  Is she in love with you?  Is that the kind of thing you want to happen?" 
"I just don't know," Dunworthy said. 
"But you want to go ahead anyway.  You want to find her and then decide how you're going to do it.  You're determined to find her.  You want to harm her." 
"I don't want to hurt her," he said. 
"But you do want to hurt her, don't you?" Colin said.  "I thought you wanted to protect her." 
"No.  I don't want to hurt her, or her feelings.  I'm just concerned that you're directing her and you know that, and you know that I'm in love with her." 
"And you want to protect her, do you?" Colin said. 
"Yes," he said. 
"What do you want to do?" Colin asked. 
"I don't know," Dunworthy said.  "I don't know what I should do, or how I should act.  I just don't know." 
"What do you think?" 
"I know what I should do." 
"Do what you want, whatever you want.  But don't think for a second that you're determined to hurt her.  You're not.  You're just a little boy." 
"Yes, I am," he said. 
"You want her to die?" 
"Yes." 
"I'm not in love with her.  I want to go to the World Prayer Service.  I want to get out of this bed and go to the Middle Ages." 
"Yes," he said. 
"Well, what are you going to do?" Colin asked.  "You want to keep her as safe as you can, and then you'll be involved in all this, will you?" 
He was staring at the wall, his mouth open, his face suddenly expressionless.  "I'm going to do the right thing," he said and gave a little shudder.  "I'm going to do it." 
Dunworthy nodded.  "What right do I have to do it, do you think?  What if I tell you that you're not a responsible person for what happened?" 
"Yes," Colin said, "you think I should.  I know what you think I should do." 
"Yes, I think you should.  But then you're not a responsible person, aren't you?  A little boy who didn't do anything, who didn't see anything, who gave up and then you thought some guy had got killed.  What kind of person would do that?" 
"I don't know," Colin said, sounding as if he were about to cry.  "What if I tell you I'm sorry?  What if I say I'm sorry?  What if I say I don't want to be like you?  Can you tell me that?" 
Dunworthy shook his head.  "Can I tell you that, Colin?" 
Colin looked at him blankly, the expression on his face like a painting on the wall.  "What if I say I'm sorry?  Can I say I'm sorry if I say I'm sorry?  Would you kill me, do you think?  Would I be like you?  Would I tell you that?" 
He looked at Dunworthy.  "What if I tell you I'm sorry?" he said, looking at him blankly.  "Would you kill me?  I don't want to go to the Middle Ages." 
"No, of course not," Dunworthy said.  "You wouldn't go there either.  You'd want to stay safe.  You're too young." 
"But you're not," Colin said.  "You're not in the Middle Ages.  You're in Oxford.  The Middle Ages didn't exist."  He looked at him, and the look on his face was almost too stern, as if he was trying to make up for the loathing he had felt at seeing him.  "You're not in the Middle Ages, you're in the Middle Ages, and you're not in Oxford, and you're not in any of the places

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. They had to be made of metal, and they stood at a long distance from the road, and they were empty.

"What is it?" Harvey asked.

"If you don't know," Mark said, "I don't know."

Harvey asked, "What's going on?"

"We were just talking about it," Mark said. "Nothing much. I mean, it's real. I can see the road up to the top, and more coming after. Lots of trucks. No cars, so it's a lot easier to watch. And we're getting closer. The road's been going pretty fast, it looks like it's heading in for the road."

"What are we going to do?" Harvey asked.

"You know," Mark said. "There are a lot of people who want to get up there. I think they'll find it. The road's all there, but they can't get to it. They can't get up to it either. I don't think they'll try to, but they can't."

"So it's all up to the people who want to get up there?" Harvey asked.

"Pretty much," Mark said. "Not to us. It's not us. Not yet. But if it comes up it will be us. Not a damn thing to stop them. And if it comes it'll be us."

"And there's nothing we can do?"

"I don't know," Mark said. "Maybe. Maybe not." He turned, and they were alone.

"It's there," Mark said. He gestured to the road above, and the truck was drawing up. "It's coming. It always is. It's part of it."

"What will happen to us?" Harvey asked.

"We'll have to take some chances. For now we can only drive toward it. It's not dangerous. But it's a big truck. It'll stop lots of people. There are a lot of them, and they'll get out of it."

"You know," Harvey said, "I don't think I ever thought of it before."

"It's dangerous."

"Yes. I guess so." Harvey nodded. He sat beside Mark. They drove for a time, and then, suddenly, Mark said, "We can't go back to the Stronghold. They're sure as hell going to shoot us down. Or at least they're going to try to. And we can't do anything about it."

"It's all up to them," Harvey said. He stood beside Mark and looked down at the road below. It was a long way down. "I guess we're all of us going to get killed together. One way or another, we have to do something."

"I'll go tell them," Mark said. "I can't wait here."

"You can't."

"You don't think I will?"

"Yes." Mark nodded.

"We have to get up to that hill," Harvey said. He was standing up now. "But I don't think we'll do it. Not now. Not with what we've got here. And anyhow, they've got a lot more strength than us. You'll give it all away to them. Let's get back to the Stronghold."

"All right."

"Let's get away from the road and take off," Harvey said. He was exhausted, but he was not tired. "I'll call in a few scouts."

"They're sure as hell not," Mark said. "It's all up to them."

"Which way will they go?" Harvey asked.

"Straight up to the road. They'll follow it up, then curve, right and take off, and I'll walk up and watch them. They won't try to stop us. We'll be all right, but I don't want to get in their way. If we get out of the way, we'll be safe. Until we get back in their way. We're going to have to take chances. It might be hopeless."

"I guess you are," Harvey said. He went back to Mark and sat beside him. "You're right. If we can stay alive until we get out of this hell hole, we're okay. Who's got a better head than you?"

"Maybe . . . yes. Well, we'll worry about that later. Now let's get back to the road. I want to see the Stronghold again, and I want to see it more."

"Right."

Harvey drove east, toward the south. He turned north at last, heading east. The road was well traveled. He wouldn't get there

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

    He looked up and down the road, and there was nothing there.

    He turned back and stared at the empty street.

    "Where are the rest of the campers?"

    "There are five of them. They've gone to the shelter. They were all
killed."

    "So, you're not going to tell me any more."

    "You have a right to know more than you've told me already," said the
bureaucrat. "And you have a right to make a report to the Secretary of State. I
told you, I don't tell anybody."

    "What about the other two campers?"

    "They are too hurt."

    "Then how can you go back to them?"

    "It's the way we've always done. We never stop for pity."

    "What about the fence?"

    "You can't go back to the fence. You have no right to go."

    "But you can't stop me, either."

    "I can't stop you," said the bureaucrat. "You have no right to stop me."

    "You have no right to stop me."

    "I can stop you. You have no right to stop me. You have no right to stop me."

    "You are the one who is supposed to know the whole situation," said the
bureaucrat. "You are the one who gets reports. You call me and I will get
reports. You tell me now, and I'll make them."

    "I don't see what you're driving at," said Sheridan. "You don't have any
right to stop me. You have no right to force me to stop you."

    "You tell me, then," said the bureaucrat. "I tell you, I don't know any
more."

    He stood a moment, then his hand moved to the gun and moved it
silently.

    "I will tell you," he said.

    He put the gun down and his hand touched the gun again. He hesitated for
a moment, then put it away.

    "It's all right," he said. "I know all that's happened. I'm sorry. I'm going
to turn in."

    He turned and walked slowly out of the room.

    "He has a right to know," said the bureaucrat. "He mustn't stop you. I
told him you'd do it, but he mustn't stop me."

    "You are wrong," said Sheridan. "I'm sorry I talked so much."

    "He has a right to know," said the bureaucrat. "I'm sorry I spoke so
much."

    He stood a moment in front of Sheridan, looking at him with his
double eye, his face a pale green of surprise and surprise. Then he put
his hand on Sheridan's shoulder and said, "We're all wrong together. He
has a right to know."

    Sheridan put his arm around his neck and kissed the hand. He put it
away and said, "I don't think I can."

    "He doesn't have a right to know," said the bureaucrat. "I am sorry for
that. I wish you'd never talked like that. It's a sin, and it's the
sin of the wicked."

    "We have a right to know," said Sheridan. "You'll tell us now. You'll say
it right away."

    "I can't explain it," said the bureaucrat. "It's beyond me. I have no
words to use. No one can explain it. You have no idea of how I feel."

    "I have," said Sheridan. "I'm sorry. I wish I could."

    "You can't," said the bureaucrat. "It's beyond me. And you're not
willing to explain it to us."

    "Then," said Sheridan, "you're not going to tell us, are you?"

    "I suppose I have," said the bureaucrat. "I don't think I can explain it. It
seems to me it's too complicated. There are so many things that we don't
have words for. We can't say, 'We can't explain this.' It's too much to
do. We don't

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
     "Go on," I said. "Don't stop."
     "No one is stopping you?"
     "I don't want to stop. You're the one who's stopping me.
     "Okay, okay. No point in stopping me."
     "And I thought you'd never stop."
     "You think I don't know that? You think I'm an idiot?
You know I've stopped, right? How do I know that?"
     He was very annoyed.
     "I am."
     "You're an idiot, both of you."
     "And I thought you'd be confused. You're both on the trail
of something that you can't stop. You're heading toward something
that you can't stop, and you can't even stop yourself. Am I right?"
     "Right," I said. "And what do you want me to do?"
     He frowned.
     "I don't want you to stop," he said. "I don't want to stop.
And I don't want to stop you. I don't have to."
     "You don't have to stop."
     "I don't have to stop you. I don't have to stop you. But I
don't want to. I don't want to stop you. I just want to say good
by to you. I want to let you go."
     "I'll do it."
     "Yes, you will. But don't do it just because I said it.
You don't have to force yourself. You don't have to pretend that
you're not there. You're just there, like the marsh and all, and
you're just following it along."
     He was annoyed, and he knew that I knew he'd be annoyed,
because he'd been annoyed before.
     "What's the matter with you?" he said. "You're always
just there. You always will be there. You don't stop. You
just go on. That's what I told you. You're just following it along.
You don't stop. You just go on. The moment I say, 'All right,
then,' you're there. You are there."
     He looked at me and I knew he was angry, because he was
being angry, and I knew he was annoyed because he knew that
he was being angry, but there was nothing more for him to
say. He just walked off and he did not stop and he didn't stop.
He was just walking away and he did not stop.
     I walked along after him and as soon as he was out of sight,
I was halfway back toward the house and I could see the back of
the house and I saw a figure just coming up the road.
     I stood still and I wondered what it was. There were
strawberries in bloom, and a big black spider that came hopping
along, and maybe it was Nathan Anteil, but even that wasn't
worth much, just a toy spider, with a big stuffed shirt on the
front and the skirt hiked up high, but even that wasn't worth much
more than a toy spider, with its face looking sad as if it knew
what was going on and it was sorry.
     There was no one else with the spider. He had not seen him,
and there was no one else coming, but a figure could be seen
coming and standing just where the spider had stood.
     I waited, but I had no idea at all what to do.
     I could see the figure coming and I could see him, but
there was no one else. The figure came very close, but it was
not the one I had seen before. It was taller than the spider and
thick and its legs were crooked, as if someone had twisted them
too much, as if they were warped with the force of his step.
     It did not stop. It came closer, and as it came closer,
I saw that the top of the head was dimpled.
     Then, as if he had grown accustomed to coming so close, the
figure passed me and went on, and I could see that it was a
very thin man, his hair all messed up with gray hair and
his face very thin. He did not look old, or if he did

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. They had set up their sets of screens above the parking lot so that the sun would not shine on the cars, and had stretched their metal rungs until they were almost invisible. They were parked in a row facing a pair of razor-thin concrete blocks.

"You had to let her get in," he said to Rydell. "She's a big deal, and she'd like to get on your side. You're her protector here, remember?"

The men were in white suits, and he wore a black shirt, and his black tie was undone. His glasses were on, and he looked very serious.

"There is no way," the man said, "to agree on what you have to say. I am a lawyer, not an attorney." He raised his head and looked very serious.

"It's true," Rydell said, and smiled. "Just go away."

"You are a PROTESY officer," the man said. His voice was very calm. "You are a former police officer, I believe. You have no rights here."

Rydell shrugged. He didn't want to argue, and maybe he should. He said, "You don't want to meet her."

"But she has a gun."

"What's that?"

"That's her gun. She has a gun."

"My friend," he said, "you have no reason to believe that she has a gun?"

"No," Rydell said, "but I believe she does."

"Why?"

"Because," Rydell said, "I think it's in the hermetic."

"Aren't you going to tell her that you're a COP?"

"No," Rydell said, "but I am."

"You are a COP?"

"Yes."

"I don't think you're going to tell her that."

"No," Rydell said, "but I am."

"But you are in LA."

"Yes," Rydell said, "but I am not in LA."

"LA," the man said, "is a medium."

"Yes," Rydell said. "You are a COP. You are in LA. You have no right to bring me here."

"You have no right," the man said. "You will simply go away." He looked directly into Rydell's face. "You will have no further contact with her. You will return to your person. You will be arrested."

"Why?"

"Because," the man said, "you have no desire to live."

"No," Rydell said. "No."

"You have no wish to live?"

"No," Rydell said. "No, not until you've told her who I am."

"You are a COP, Rydell."

"No," Rydell said. "I can't do it."

"That's right," the man said, "you have no wish to live."

"You are a COP," Rydell said. "You are going to read me my rights."

"You are an officer of the law," the man said, "and I am a cop." He looked at his watch. "Two o'clock."

"Time," Rydell said.

"Time," the man said. "I have to go."

"Rydell," the man said, "you are under arrest."

"No," Rydell said, "no. That's just what I'm telling you. You are going to make me a cop, and you are going to want to go to jail."

"Time," the man said, "is a fine thing. I have a claim on you."

"I have no right to try to force you to do anything," Rydell said, "unless you want to try to kill me."

"I have no right to kill you," the man said. "That is the contract I have with you. But you will please take care of yourself. You will not, in the future, be in my shoes. Thank you."

"But I have a right to kill you," Rydell said.

"Yes," the man said, "you do."

"I'm going to make sure I'm never alone with you," Rydell said.

"That's what you're going to accomplish," the man said.

"But I don't know what you're going to accomplish," Rydell said.

"I know what you are going to accomplish," the man said

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. A longshore boat passed close to the lighthouse. Its captain was an old man in a white hat.

"Fifty years ago," she said. "That was when I came here. Nineteen years ago."

"But it's a hundred thousand years."

"Yes. That's the way it is with miracles and the supernatural."

"I see." I didn't see her, but she was watching me. "Why are you looking at me?"

"You're looking at everything," I said.

"It was an act of kindness," she said. "I wanted to do something for you. I was really trying to. You were in such trouble, with your chest hurt."

"It's not a chest hurt," I said. "It's just that I was so worried about you. I wanted to make you feel better."

"I want to be just like the others," she said. "The others are looking at me. They expect me to be like them."

"They're not God," I said.

"No. They're just looking at the shore, where they are. That's why they call me. You're the judge. The jury will hear you, and they will decide whether you are God or the jury."

"The jury already has?"

"Yes. They were supposed to decide that between now and the day of judgment."

"And what will that do for you?"

"I don't know."

"Why not?"

"I don't know because I don't know what life is and I'm just going to live it. It's not me, it's not what I want to be. The others will do what they're told, and there'll be nothing, no more life. And then I'll have to live it, and there's nothing for me anywhere."

"There's nothing for me anywhere," I said.

"But you're not God," she said. "Because you've got to live your life, and whatever happens to you may be bad, but it's not your fault. It's not your fault. You had your life, you're going to live it. You're going to judge the world, and you're going to do the right thing, even though it may be just the wrong thing, and it may not be any better than any other life."

"But what's wrong?"

"What do you want to know?"

"Why do I want to know?"

"Because I want to live every day of my life, every hour of every day. The only time that matters is now, and I don't care how long it is, I'm going to be with you."

"And I am going to die," I said.

"You are," she said.

"Die?"

"You said the word. You said it. You said it. If you die, it's because I died, because I died to save you, because I was the one who killed her. You're the one who died, you're going to die. You have to die."

"But I didn't die."

"You did. You have to die."

"Why?"

"Because you're the only one who knows, and I did, and you know, and you can't change me, and I'm going to die, and you can't save me, and I'm going to die, because you said it, you said you're going to die, and I'm going to die."

She looked away from me, away from me, and she was a wall of rock, and I was a stone, and she was very small, and her voice was small and soft and beautiful.

"Do you think I would have killed her?"

"You're foolish."

"You are? Do you think I would have murdered her? You don't know who she is. She is my sister. She is the child I made. I made her. She is my sister. She is my sister. She is me."

"But you're only one thing. You don't have to be so."

"No. I don't. I don't have to have to be like the others. I have no right to be like them."

"You don't have to have your sister."

"No. I don't. I don't."

"But you have to be like them. You have to be like them. They made you. They made you to be. You're just them. They never made you anything."

"No. They made me."

"Yes. You are right. You are right, now

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The birds were singing as they gathered at the water's edge.
"Come, now," she said. "You and your damnable stupid smiles."
I looked at her. "You're angry?"
"No, madame," she said. "But you're right."
"I'm not angry," I said. "I just don't know who you are."
"You said you had no secrets," she said. "That's good. You really have no secrets."
"Yes," I said.
"Do you know what I did, then?" she asked.
"No," I said.
"Do you know who killed the old man, the fat one, the one who was only a wrinkled old man?"
"No," I said.
"Do you know who killed that other one, the one who was only a wrinkled old man?"
"No," I said.
"Do you know who killed the first one, the one who was only a little bit younger than you, the one who was only a sense of humor, a gag, a gag, a gag, a gag, a gag? Do you know who killed them all, the one who was only a little bit younger than you, the one who was only a sense of humor, a gag, and that one, the one who was only a sense of humor, the one who was only a gag, the one who was only a sense of humor, the one who was only a gag?"
"No," I said.
"Why do you think he killed them?"
"I do not know," I said. "It was an act of vengeance. He wanted to kill them, to hurt them, to make them feel guilty. He wanted them to feel guilty, so they looked guilty, they felt guilty, because they had no power to protect themselves."
"You can kill them," she said.
"Yes, I can kill them," I said.
"You are not a killer," she said.
"No," I said. "I never even knew what a killer was. I never wanted to kill them, but I was ready, and they were not expecting me to stop and think about who might be the killer, and who might not, and who might not, and then I would kill them and do the same to them and then they would be dead and he would have gained his victory and I would have nothing to do with it because I would be finished, the way I always had been. I am not a killer. I never even wanted to know what I was doing. I wanted to kill them and finish my life with them, but I was not even that. I was a beast, and I am not a killer. I have never killed anyone."
She said nothing.
"Did I say anything wrong?" I asked.
"Nothing," she said.
"You killed the old man," I said.
"Yes," she said.
I looked at her and she looked at me, not speaking, and then she looked at me and her eyes met mine and I thought, I saw her eyes as I had seen them on that other night when she was a child and she had lost her mother and her father and she had no longer any sense of humor and she was terrified and yet she still looked at me with tears in her eyes and her face was very beautiful with love and with hate, as she had been in that other time and I had seen it before, as she looked at me now, in death, and she looked at me with tears in her eyes and then her expression was softened and she said, "Please, please," and I thought, in spite of myself, that she was a very attractive woman.
"All you needed was death," I said.
"I did not want to kill them," she said. "I loved them, I wanted to have them killed, I wanted to see them die and I did not want to hurt them. I have never felt anything like this before. I wanted to hurt them, to kill them, and yet I did not do it."
"You want to show off your uselessness as if you were a woman," I said.
"Yes," she said, "but I am not a woman. I am a creature of the earth, you know. I have no soul, no spirit, no existence save my own. I was once a mortal woman, a dark and ugly being, and now I am only a worm, a bug, my own bug, a little thing that needs to be crushed and thrown down. I know that I am a failure and a sluggard and that you are both. I know that you both are capable of saving my life and I know that you are capable of saving my life. I hope that you will save both my life and yours."

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.  The main street was empty and silent, except for the strong wind blowing from the north.  Far off, white spray from the clean-swept roads was falling on the unkempt lawns of the city.

After a long time of walking, the pair stopped beside a greenery-sculpting fountain.  Kailea gazed in wonderment at the curving wall of the fountain.  She recognized that the work of an artist had been lost in the caravanserai of a world so different from her own.

"What will you have?" Kailea asked, smiling as she leaned forward to see what the artist had envisioned for her.

"I've got a pretty painting," he said, nodding.  "A painting that I made on a desert planet."

Kailea gazed in delight at the genius of the painter, as she imagined the grandeur of the landscape.  "You have brought a painting back to Ix, brother," she said.  "I hope it's not a bad painting.  I have seen plenty of ugly ones before, especially ones with big noses and ugly eyes."

"The Ixians have a hard time with their own people," he said, lowering his voice.  "Most of the inhabitants are fine, but some of them are . . . ugh."

"Ugh?"  She leaned closer to him.  "What are you talking about?  I have such a lovely garden here.  I thought you . . . were taking pictures."

"I am."  He looked up at her, his gaze warm and sincere.  "But I am also a painter, and I have a job to do."  He chuckled.  "We have a tradition of working together, you and I."

"And I have a job to do now."

"You have done this before?"

"Not that I can recall."

"Then perhaps you can show me a couple more."  He laughed again.

After a long pause, she said, "Yes.  I'm not sure I like this painting.  I'm not sure I want to do it.  I just . . . I have to have a good laugh.  But what do you think, Kailea?"

"I think it's a beautiful painting.  It has a sad story."

"Forgive me," he said.  "It's not meant to be funny.  It's supposed to be sad."

Kailea stared at him in surprise, then her eyes filled with tears.  "You don't believe that painting can make you cry, do you?"

"Of course not.  I know I'm a beautiful woman, but I'm also a very pretty woman."  He put his arm around her.  "We have a natural affinity.  You are the most beautiful woman in the world, and I am only a very real painter."

"No man can make you happy, when he is unconscious," she said, her voice sobbing.

"No, my beautiful woman.  No man can make you happy when he is unconscious."

"You're right," she said.  "I don't want to know."

"You are not going to tell me what to do now?"

"No, I'm not going to go on," she said, her voice shaking.  "I can't bear to."

"You are a brave woman, then," he said, stroking her hair with his fingertips.  "But I am not going to make you feel like this."

She pressed against him, and his arm around her, and the two of them wept together for a long time.










The truth is that all the truth is a lie.

-LADY HELENA, from The Diary of a Woman


WHEN THE CASTLE GENTLEMEN AND THE GUEST OF THE TRIBUNE TOGETHER WITH THEIR LADY AND FARFRAE, the Montagues found their home at last, in this distant section of the city of Ix.

The ancient building, a structure known to the people of Ix as the Temple of the Merciless Astrologers, stood on what had once been the upper courtyard of the building.

Flowers bloomed in the courtyard gardens, and even in the garden, the inhabitants of Ix rested on benches and benches of polished stone, bright with lichen.  They were young, though still daughters of the people.  The men and women of Ix wore black suits and white shirts, all of them well-dressed and impeccable.  All the ancient members of the Caste of Physicians, recognizing that their leader

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

“You know what I think I’m going to have to do now,” he said.

“And what is that?”

“Have you ever, uh, used to do anything?”

“Never.”

“I don’t like having to get up, clean the sheets.”

“No bed in the morning. Not even a towel.”

“But sleep?”

“I don’t sleep.”

“So you don’t sleep.”

“No.”

“You sleep?”

“No,” he said, “but I sleep.”

“You sleep.”

“I use a brush,” he said.

“A brush?”

“A small brush. I use it to wipe the sheets. I also use a paper slipper. And one of those flat things you use for paper.”

“But if I brush the sheets, I’m going to lose my marks.”

“That’s the beauty of it.”

“You have to be kidding.”

“I am.”

“When I brush the sheets, I get a feeling,” he said.

“Feel what?”

“The softness of the sheets. The shaking of the earth.”

“You get a kind of massage?”

“Sure.”

She looked at the ceiling for a while, then looked up at the sky. “I guess I have to do it.”

“You’ll have to take care of getting the sheets clean,” he said. “That’s why you’ll have to do it.”

“You’re not kidding.”

“No, I’m not. I’m not kidding,” he said again. “Because you’re right. I’m telling you: I got a nasty feeling. I get it because I’m always doing things like this.”

She frowned slightly.

“Well, anyway,” he said, “I’m not doing this for money. It’s just that, like, I want to pay you. I’m not kidding anymore. This is the last time I’ll do anything like this. I’m in no shape to do this the rest of my life. It’s the end of the road, just like that time the Masons left, when they burned off the whole house.”

“What’s the end of the road?”

“The end of my road. I’m done with you,” he said, his voice shaking. “I’m done with everything. The one thing on earth I’m not going to do any more.”

“You’re not kidding?”

“No, I’m not.”

“Then what?”

“I’m not going to pay you. I’m not going to let you go. I can’t do this for money.”

“You don’t have to pay me.”

He stared at her. “You’ve got to pay me. You have to pay me. You have to pay me.”

“Oh, I suppose,” she said. “But what should I do?”

“Nothing,” he said.

He looked at her in the headlights. “What did you say? What’s the matter?”

She took a deep breath and said, “Nothing. Nothing at all.”

Tengo was able to ignore the fog that gathered in his heart for a long time. The fog that he had sensed in the air at the airport was probably caused by the warm wind blowing, as it had been the night before. He had been on the verge of fainting from the cold, stiff air. The day had felt like a long, long winter’s day. But the air in the glass sphere was never chilly, never cold. It was as warm as the day

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The city lights were switched on, but the view was dead.

Tengo was not moved. He waited for a long time in silence, staring at the city lights, watching as the two moons, as the moons always did, moved slowly across the sky.

I’ve been here for a long time, Tengo thought. At least that’s how it seemed to me. And I’ve seen this world at least a little bit. But it’s not real. It’s not real for me to be looking at this scene. It’s not real for anyone else to be watching, no matter how they see it. And Tengo knew this perfectly well.

The sound of the wind was growing fainter. The city sounds were gradually losing their assertiveness, fading into the distance. The rustling of the crane was becoming almost soundless. The lights on the expressway through which the train passed gradually faded into the distance.

The moon, behind the city lights, looked completely different. The light shone from a different angle, and the shadows of the buildings were much lighter than they had been. The moon’s movement across the sky was like an occasional event. The two moons were hanging there, side by side, in an airy world apart from Tengo’s apartment.

The city sounds had long since faded, but the two moons, as they drifted across the sky, maintained the same soft, gentle light. They always kept in mind the three moons, like some elegant stone bird.

The wind was more quiet. The air was heavier. The clouds were much farther away. The road to the expressway was far less crowded than it had been. Tengo had lived in this world for almost twenty years, yet now he felt nostalgic to go out this way. Perhaps it was better for him to stay here with this world than to go elsewhere.

The first thing Tengo did when he got to the expressway was look up at the sky. The moon was still there, its light so strong it felt like it was basking in the sunlight. The light of day was on the other side of the expressway, but it looked like evening was going by. Tengo looked up at the sky, the moon, and the clouds. They were still there, silently watching him. As the train passed by, the light of the moons moved steadily down the sky, like the sun at the bottom of a lake.


The light of the moons still downshone the city lights, but the light of the moon still hung over the city, enveloping it completely. It enveloped the buildings and houses, the buildings and the buildings, the buildings and the buildings. The light of the moon still downshone them.

Tengo gazed at the light of the moon for the longest time. In the world it was always dark, but in the moonlight it seemed like day was always dark. There was nothing unnatural about it. It seemed natural, like the moon’s silent embrace of night.

The moon, in this world, had given up the world of day and was living in a world of shadows. In the still air, the sound of the cranes and of the truck engines reverberated in a unique sound, the sound of wind blowing against a wall.

When the light of the moon disappeared, there was still darkness, with the shadows it had been enveloping, hanging just above the city streets.


It was almost two in the afternoon when Tengo made up his mind to leave this world. He knew it without even asking. The feeling he had was pure and absolute, like finding a piece of amber in the darkness of the air. It was an overwhelming weight, an overwhelming sense of power. It struck him as something he had lost in the act of pummeling his friend. The force that held him in place here was very strong. He knew that he had nothing to fear. In that moment he was able to accept the fact that he had nothing to fear.

This was the first time he had ever felt like holding someone’s hand. He had never been able to do it, but he had always been able to hold onto something. It was an inborn talent in Tengo.

If he was to hold someone’s hand, it would be like a rubber band—like a rubber band holding a person’s hand. If his hand was really just holding somebody’s hand, it could be quite a thing. In his own special world, however, it was an even more slender thing.

“That’s it,” Tengo said.

“A rubber band?”

“A band,”

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The hills seemed to be
          staring at the trucks as they rolled by. A few vehicles were
          heading off toward Shattuck, but the majority of the vehicles
          were headed for the game room.

          "Where's the girls?"
          "The girls? The girls? Why do you ask?"
          "I just wonder," said Harold, "if anyone wants to come to Shattuck."
          "You're sure it's a good place?"
          "Is there a map of Shattuck?" Harold asked, turning to one of the girls.
          "Yes, there is a map," she said, pulling it out of her tunic.
          "Then it's got to be bad," said Harold.
          "I don't care," she said. "I just want to go to Shattuck."
          "Then you'll have to stay there," said Harold. "Because the car
          has to stop somewhere. There's a parking lot there. It's full of
          vehicles, and it's in the sun."
          "How many people have you guys been stopping at?"
          "None," Harold said. "We're just stopping here for the day. We
          don't want to stop and shop."
          "Shopping for a girl?"
          "Yes."
          "I thought you said you had a lot of girls."
          "We have," Harold said.
          "You can't stop at Shattuck," she said.
          "It's a big town," Harold said. "Lots of shops and a lot of
          people."
          "I don't want to stop here."
          Harold paused for a moment. "Well," he said, "it's not stopping at
           all."
           "I'm sorry."
           "It's not stopping at all," Harold said. "I just want to go
           stop somewhere for a day or two."
           "It's just a walking-stop," she said.
           Harold shrugged. "It's not stopping anywhere. It's just
           stopping in some places."
           "If I stop here," she said, "I'll get on my way."
           "You can't walk," Harold said. "You can't get anywhere. You
           know that. You can't get anywhere in any of these towns."
           "That's true," she said.
           "Well, you can stop anywhere in these towns, but where in them
           towns do you think you can stop and not be stopped?"
           "That's true."
           "Well, I'll get off this train and I'll walk through some
           thing, but not stop somewhere. Stop in some place, not
           anywhere. That's what I said before."
           "You have said it many times," she said. "You just never
           stop. You just walk, you never stop."
      

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The air was too thin to produce sounds, and the sun glistened against the marble cliffs. The whole scene was unreal, as if the play had taken place in someone else’s memory.

The light at the bottom of the stairs was too pale to be white, and the shadows too large. I stood there until the light was stronger, then walked slowly down the gentle slope. I turned right at the bottom, and then went back to the bench. The bench was much harder than I had imagined it would be. I sat there, eyes closed, for a long time. I felt as if my life had been planned for me. I imagined the pain of my cut of wood; I imagined the loneliness of my shadow. I imagined the touch of the woman’s hand as it held the chubby hand of the boy and turned away. I pictured the young girl, wrapped in the dark cloak, coming downstairs to find me. I imagined her kneeling at my feet, with the soft white cloth she’d brought. I imagined her kissing my ear. And I imagined her coming up to me, and kissing me, as if she knew exactly what I was doing.

It was a long time before I realized that my cut of wood had been soaked through. The liquid moonlight glinted off the wood, the sharp-edged blade sticking out of the stump of my stump. The chubby woman had been right: I had thought it was much too wet to be white.

I stood up from the bench, and the light from the moonlight went off the old man’s stump. His eyes remained deep in the shadows, like a shadowed, old bird’s eyes, staring at the scene above. I had to get out of here. I had to get out of this.

The boy’s silhouette floated in the air, perfectly still. He was like a living spirit in a dream. The woman could never even have looked at him.

I stood there for a long time, watching the girl and listening to the sounds of the forest. I knew that I would never leave. I knew that I would never leave this room, but I knew that I would never leave. I would never leave. It was a different world that I had entered. It was another world that I’d entered. I’d entered the world of the living. That was the meaning of life.





CHAPTER 7


The woman was right. The child was a part of it. The woman had to be right.

What could it mean to be born into a new world? What could there possibly be in there? Is there any hope for anyone to tell me that I’ve already left? No, there’s no need to worry about it.

It was as if the woman were speaking to me from another part of my mind. I could hear her words, but they were just words, set in a space, like a code or a script. There were no real meanings to them, no meaning that I could interpret. They were just an imaginary space that I held in my mind, as if the words were a set piece in a game.

This made me even more confused. I had to ask myself the question of why I’d formed such a strange mental image in the midst of something completely different. And it was such a very stupid question. What possible connection could there be between the two images there? There was no way in which one could possibly be in the other’s place. You can’t move an object that way, and that’s not natural. And the thing to do is to ask yourself why you’ve formed the image in the first place.

The woman still floated in the dark, her legs still moving with the rhythm of the butterfly. The tall woman beside her was no longer a woman, but a woman. She was no longer a woman. Her skin was not her own, but she had a strange touch about her. Strange, unnatural, it seemed to me. It was as if the woman’s being a woman had just come to life and was staring at me, staring at me from the inside. It was a strange sensation. I couldn’t get an accurate grasp on it, but it felt strange.

The woman’s eyes were fixed on mine. The thick black eyebrows were drawn in. I could see the deep creases there. They were looking at a point far away. The woman must be looking at me.

I felt utterly lost.

What was this all about?

“Welcome home,” she said.

“Whose is it?” I asked.

“The image you have in your head.”

I

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.  "How long do you suppose they'll last, Concera?"

"As long as they are up there, no one can come to get them.  After all, I asked him to make me something to eat.  That's all I can think of now."

"Then you won't starve.  You'll just die."

"No.  I'm going to be fine."

"But you're fine.  You've survived.  You were fine when we found you.  You were fine when we found you, and you're fine now."

The gaudy but elegant cathedral fell away below them as they walked back toward the main runway.  As they walked down the road toward the city center, the city skyline looked palatial and timeless.  A few small clouds floated in the sky, however, and the sunlight sparkled off the icy crystal spires.

"Where is it?"  Fenring asked.

"Right here, closer to the city center."  He didn't look in that direction, but his gaze dropped over the stone roofs of the city, where the snow capped cliffs and the dark forests surrounded the narrow valley.  The city had been buried in the bedrock, so that it looked like the city of an ancient, forgotten race.

"I don't believe it."

"What's this, then?"  Fenring snapped.  "A rebellion of some kind?  A mad revolution?  What are you trying to do, Maroon?"

"I'm not.  I don't want to destroy the planet, or its people.  I just want to go away and live with something better."

"Aww, now, we've got some good news for you, little fella.  What do you want to do with that spice you stole from so many of your friends?"

"I'm not sure what to do with it."

"You can't tell me what to do with it."

"I can tell you, though."

"Show it to me, then."

The Lord Leto tossed his head, as much as to say, You can't tell me, you're not a man.  The visions of his ancestors were too convincing for him to see.

"Let me take it," he said.  "I know exactly what I should do with it."

The gaudy but elegant cathedral vanished.  The air became cold and harsh with the tang of ozone.  The snow-capped cliffs were as barren as the sands of an uninhabited island.  The fog swallowed the distant sounds of running water.

"Your life is a fight," Fenring said.  "It might be better for you to think of it from a different angle.  And now, I don't think you have to be so careful about keeping your eyes open.  You just have to be a little more observant."

"My life is my own life," the Crown Prince said, and he turned to look out again at the snow-capped cliffs.  "Do I look like an idiot after all?  I am the Emperor of the Known Universe, and nobody could ever make me throw up."

"I can't judge you," Fenring said, and he thought of the Mandrakes.  The mandrakes had led the Atreides campaign, and they could still be recalled to the aid of House Corrino.  The Atreides had been a brilliant leader, with a heart that had risen with hope for the future.

"You're wrong, my friend," Leto said.  "I don't feel like an emperor, just a man.  My life belongs to me."

"Exactly.  You're the man who is supposed to be the perfect Emperor."  Fenring lowered his voice, but his words carried far more weight than he had intended.

"Do I look like an emperor?" Leto asked, feeling more than ever a slight urge to question the man further.

"What you do with it, you know," the old man said, "is your own business."


FOR YEARS WITH ALL HIS HEIGHTS, Leto had tried to follow his father's advice and save the world.  At times, he thought, he had found himself much more at home than the Atreides, but he was still far from being a leader.  In the end, he realized that he was just a grunt, a ghola of his father's legacy.

As a child, Leto had wanted nothing more than to be the greatest Duke, though he knew better now.  He had tried to remain a civilian, though his life had been far more pleasant than that of his father.  He

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.



A man sat at the bar, a man I had never seen before.  His clothes were old, and stained with green moss.  The sun had set and a mist lingered in the sky and the golden light of evening.  It shone on his face, as if the man were a recluse at a candle-making.  His face was sunken and sunken, as if the pressure of years had eaten it up and buried it.  The deep, guttural voice that spoke with a life-long pause and a strange emphasis in the phrase "I am a man," was resonant and expressive, a voice of power and authority that rose above the impersonal tones of the lifeless bar.  It shook the still, lifeless, old man with the confidence of magic, a voice that had the power to take the lonely, old-fashioned man by the hand and teach him the mysteries of life to him.  I had never heard of such a man.  I had never really seen him, but the sight of him was enough.  The light of the fire cast upon his face and his hands and his feet and his hair, and the light of the fire made him a picture of a man of power and strength, a brilliant, clear-cut, mocking face.

"A man of power?" I asked.

The man looked at me in surprise, and then his face lost the innocence and cruelty that had come to it.  His eyes narrowed and he said, "Who are you, Caramon?"

"You are Tasslehoff Burrfoot," I said, and I was surprised at myself, for I had not thought of him before.  I looked at him with a kind of wonder, as if I had known him before, and realized that I had never known him before.

"You must be a friend of the people who ride the dragon," he said.

"Oh, yes," I said.  "I am."

"I am Tasslehoff Burrfoot, and I have come to offer my services to them."

"As a friend of the people?"

"As a brother."

"As a friend of the people?"

"As a steward."

"I am honored to have you as my steward," he said, and his voice was as cold as the wind.

"I am honored to have you as my steward," I said.

"I am honored to have you as my steward," he said, and his voice was even colder than the wind.

"I am honored to have you as my steward," I said again.

"As a friend of the people," he said, "I am honored to be your servant."

He rose to his feet and extended his hand, palm up, to me.

"You have come to prove me a coward," he said.

"You have come to prove yourself a coward," I said.

"No, no," he said, "you are not the same man I am."

"I am not the same man," I said.

He looked at me in surprise, his eyes widening with surprise, and then, somehow, I understood him.

"You are the same man," he said, "as I am to you."

"Oh, yes, I am the same man to you," I said, glancing at him in surprise.

He glanced at me, his eyes glimmering, his lips parted in a smile, and then, as if waiting for a response, he turned and walked across the bar toward me.

He stood there, the lantern in his hand, and I watched him as he went out the door, not seeing him go, but at least knowing he was going with me.  It was the same man who had brought me back to the Coliseum.

What had I ever said back in that place?  I was sure I had said nothing at all, not even to myself, but I had been certain, and I felt certain that I had said nothing, and I knew I had said nothing, but then, it seemed, I had not said much.  It was not the sort of thing that anyone could believe to be true, but I knew that I had said something to myself, and I knew that I had meant something to say to the man, and I knew that I had not meant anything to say to him, and I had been foolish to have said much to him, and now, suddenly, I saw the meaning of the words I had said to myself and the terrible, shining light of knowledge that had shone in them, as if lightning had struck them and broken them and they were shining now, like the eyes of a whip, and they were

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The red sun glinted off the steel, blue and white, making the landscape look even more barren than it had before.

A chill wind came down from the mountains, laden with crests of snow, spurring clouds of dark dust that stirred in the air. The leaves of the cherry-trees gleamed like bronze, and the white snowflakes sparkled in the wind.

“Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! Kobun! “ The wind roared at them, hurling snowballs so hard that the trees and the flowers grew unstirring.

The sky was a pale azure one through the durrix of the snow, but above it, already thick with condensation, lay a straggling cloudlike layer of clouds. As they stared at the sky, the trees and the flowers grew bolder, their trunks even thicker than before, as if the snow had scooped them from the earth. The blossoms themselves seemed more than a season old now, their thrones of bloom forgotten in the beauty of the winter. Kobat, the snowflakes flashing in the wind, gazed on the land with unfeigned wonder.

They sat silent, each watching the snowflakes, each holding his own breath, each mumbling or thinking aloud. Kobat took a few steps, then stopped. The wind had died. The snow had only a thin coating.

“Kobat! Kobat! Kobat! Kobat! Kobat! Kobat! Kobat! ’Seems to be a real storm,” said the boy. “I can feel it.” Kobat rubbed his eyes, his lips. He leaned toward the boy and lifted his hand. “So that’s how it is,” he said. “I wonder—”

The boy stood there, small and kneeling, and smiled.

“Sorry,” Kobat said. “I don’t know anything.” He looked at the snow. “It looks like a lot of snow, doesn’t it? It looks like snow the same color as it is here. But it isn’t snow. It’s a big world,” he said, his words frozen in the air.

The boy looked up at him, and smiled. “I think it’s not snow,” he said.

“It’s just the snow,” Kobat said. “A real snow. It’s the world we live in. It’s snow everywhere. It’s snow that covers the land, snow that covers everything.”

The boy nodded.

“I think I’ve seen you before,” Kobat said. “I’m not sure. I remember the snow. I’m not sure about this place. I can only repeat it. I know this is a place I saw before. But I can remember this time. This is no place where I saw snow. This is the place where snow is real. I can see it, but I can’t see it. The only thing I can remember is the light. The light of a snowstorm. You can’t see it with the eye, but I can see it with the eye. I know that’s what I saw.”

“This is your world,” the boy said.

Kobat opened his mouth, closed it, and let his lips descend slowly on the boy’s hand. The boy’s fingers gently stroked Kobat’s fingers. Kobat opened his mouth and let his tongue out. The boy smiled and held out his hand. Kobat took it. The boy took it.

Kobat took the hand and held it. “Good,” he said. “It’s good to see you again. I’m glad. But I can’t stay here forever. There are so many things I have to do. I have to get home, look for my father, and make a good clean breast of it.”

Kobat was about to give the hand back, but it stopped him. He looked at Kobat with eyes that had no expression, eyes without depth. “You don’t belong here,” Kobat said. “It’s all just snow. It’s all just snow. I don’t belong here.”

“I belong here,” Kobat said. “Wherever here is.

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

“I don’t have a car,” I said. “Can’t afford an English car.”

“Well, then, what would you like to do?” she asked.

I had a moment to mull that over.

“I’d like to take the train to Hakone,” I said. “It’s easy to get there if you take the Yamanote Line.”

“But it’s not easy to get back,” she protested.

“Then go to a phone booth. I have a place here where I can put you up.”

“But don’t worry. I have no money.”

“You have to pay the hotel,” I said. “You can get into a phone booth, but it costs a lot.”

“You don’t want to pay the hotel, do you?”

I looked at her without a word.

“I’m not worried about that,” she said. “It’s just that you’re such an odd person. You don’t understand at all.”

“But I do understand,” I said. “But why would anyone do such a stupid thing?”

“It’s simple,” she said. “You want to know who you are, and I don’t. I can’t explain it to you. I don’t have the slightest idea.”

“Do you think there’s anything wrong with me?”

“Not at all,” she said, “not at all. I don’t care who knows.”

She stopped to take a puff on her cigarette and glanced at me.

“I’m not mad,” she said. “I just want to get out of this one place. I just want to get out of this building.”

“But why don’t you? You don’t have any money.”

“That’s not why,” she said. “I just want to leave.”

“But I’m just after the money, the same as you.”

“Exactly,” she said, and smiled. “But I have to take it alone.”

“Money is a very strange thing,” I said. “Money is very strange.”

“Why does it seem so strange?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know why.”

She sighed, closed her eyes, and let the smoke go.

“Money is a very strange thing. It’s not something you can simply disappear with. It’s like a door that opens in the middle of the night. I know I’m going to make a big issue of this, but I just can’t. I can’t be sure what’s going to happen to me. Money is very strange.”

“Strange.”

“It’s like an invisible wall. I’m trying to get through to some other person, but I can’t. I know I’m going to spend a lot of time in this town, spend a lot of money, but I can’t get through. I can’t keep my eyes open. I can’t read, can’t write.”

“That’s strange.”

“I know,” she said. “I know that I’m going to spend a lot of time here. That’s just the way it is. It’s true. But I can’t just go anywhere, anywhere. I can’t go anywhere, even to the end of the world.”

“But there’s something you can do.”

“Yes, I can do that. I’ve been here for a very long time, and I’ve seen a lot of different people. Not that many people are born in that town—that town’s a really small town. There’re hardly any old people here at all. But I do meet a lot of people.”



-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The boys had gone over to one of the construction cranes, stood with it, and set the platform on the platform. Now they waited for someone to come along and push a switch.

    The platform and the crane were in shadow.

    "I have brought along a chair," said Deke Wilson. "You are not to sit on the platform."

    "I can stand," said Jack Woods. "You are to sit in the chair."

    The great chair was a tall pole of wood, with a flat top. The chairs were designed for many people. They had chairs for the army and their wives and children, and others, in a long row of standing stones. All the others were in suits and sleeping jackets.

    The two from the FBI sat at the end of the platform, staring down at the crowd. From the front of the platform came a man in a white coat, who waved the same sort of hand that he had waved at the crowd on the platform.

    "Welcome," said the man. "I am Jack Woods. I am the Marshal in charge of the federal narcotics operations." He was dressed in a blue uniform, a tie, and a watch. His tie was red and gold, and his watch was blue and gold. He wore glasses, and his boots were white ones, and he carried a cane and a revolver.

    "We have a warrant," said Jack Woods, "for your arrest."

    The man waved a red handkerchief. "I do not have one."

    "You don't have any," said Jack Woods. "Where are you staying?"

    "The building is off the street."

    "I have a search warrant here," said the man. "We have been searching for the hotel, but we have not located it."

    "How do you know where to look?"

    "I have a gun," said the man.

    "But you don't know where to look," said Jack Woods. "You can't get a warrant from someone you don't know."

    The man's eyes flashed in the direction of the crowd. "Who are you?" he asked.

    "My name is Jack Woods," said Jack Woods. "You don't have a warrant. I don't want one. You don't have one yourself. Where are you going?"

    "I have no idea," said the man. "I don't know where to look."

    "You have a gun. A double-barrelled shotgun," said Jack Woods.

    "That is correct," said the man. "I have a forty-eight pistol."

    "You don't have a warrant," said Jack Woods. "I don't know you. You don't have one. Where are you staying?"

    "The woman," said the man. "She is staying there."

    "You are not staying there," said Jack Woods. "You have no warrant. You don't know who I am, and you don't have a warrant. You don't know who I am, and you don't have a warrant. You have no warrant. I don't know you. I have no right to stop you, except by force. I have no right to tell you to stay where you are. If I do, then I have no right to tell you to come with me. You have no warrant. I have no right to stop you."

    "You don't have a right," said the man.

    "You are too polite," said Jack Woods. "I have no right to stop you. You have no right to stop me. You have no right to stop me. You have no right to use my firearm. You have no right to kill me. You have no right to hurt me. You have no right to kill me. You have no right to kill me. I have no right to kill you. You have no right to use my firearm, and you have no right to kill me. You have no right to waste my ammunition. You have no right to hurt me. You have no right to kill me. I have a pistol, you have a pistol, you have a thirty-eight pistol, and you have a forty-eight revolver. You have no right to use your pistol. I have a shotgun. You have a thirty-eight revolver. You have a forty-eight revolver. You have a thirty-eight. You have a twenty-eight handgun. You have an American pistol. You have a forty-eight. You have a twenty-eight."

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. A few cars were parked at the gate, and a number of trucks. They were heading off. Several bright blue vans were waiting for them. When the vans saw the men, some of them rose and followed them back to the gate.

"Hey," said the black man. "You going to do any more work?"

"I guess so," said Rydell.

"You get enough sleep?"

"Enough," Rydell said.

"Good," said the black man, and smiled.

"You know me?"

"Sure," Rydell said, and smiled. "You're Dog Guys, right?"

"Well," said the black man, "you haven't seen me before." He winked at Rydell. "And you," he said to the woman, "you're Rydell, right?"

"Yes," she said.

"Well," said the black man, "we are going to do business with you. You understand?" He nodded at the cars.

"Well," said Rydell, "you can't just walk out on me, can you?"

"That's right," said the black man, "you forgot who we are."

"Oh," said Rydell, and watched as the woman looked at him. "Well," Rydell said, "you are Cash, right?"

"Yes, yes," Cash said, and smiled.

"I think I'd like to meet you," Rydell said, "if you'll excuse us, I have to ask

"Who is Cash?"

"The man who was with me, at the hotel."

"How did you know where to find him?"

"Because I'm his escort," Cash said. "He was here earlier, asking me to look for X

"Where are we going?"

"I have to get a cab," Cash said. "I'll send a cab."

"No," Rydell said. "Cash, you don't mind being with me, do you?"

"No," Cash said. "Where are we going?"

"You have the air?"

"Yes," Rydell said.

They got out of the cab, Rydell behind them, Cash trailing along at their side.

"Where are we going?" Cash asked. "To San Francisco?"

"No," Rydell said, "where is that?"

"I think you know," Cash said. "Because you are the police. Where is San Francisco,

man?"

"I think I know it," Rydell said.

"You have no objection to my taking you on?"

Rydell shook his head.

"Give me the gun," Cash said.

Rydell looked at the gun in his hand. It looked like a big gun.

"We have an idea," Cash said, "a plan. A great plan. It is quite simple,

simple and direct. You are Cash, you are Rydell, you have an attorney,

you are a suspect, you are a wanted felon, you are wanted by the

police, and there is an important witness who you must

not have. And you are a U.S. citizen, so act like yourself and I will

put you on the list."

Rydell looked at him, not really believing him.

"Where are we going to take you?" Cash asked.

"Where else?"

"Well," Cash said, "I thought you said San Francisco."

"Yes," Rydell said, "but the airport's in L.A., and I think that's a

great idea."

"We are going to take you to San Francisco," Cash said. "Take you to the

slaughterhouse. We will send a bureau man to take your fingerprints and

card, and you are to register at the morgue. The bureau man will take your

handprints and remove them and put them in your wallet. Now you are to get

out of the way."

"I will die," said Rydell.

"That's what I thought you said," Cash said.

"So do I," said Rydell.

"And where are we going to take you?"

"Son of a bitch," Rydell said.

"Very well," Cash said. "Let's go."

"I'm in a hurry," Rydell said. He scrambled to get into the

front, by the door, and saw the red-haired woman waving her

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.  The image of the tall tower at its base was too strong to fade.

Leto had heard nothing from Rhombur so far, but he knew the younger man's suspicions.  A rumor had already spread, and it was being circulated through the Empire, by word of mouth, at the highest levels.  The earliest whispers suggested a time bomb, and everything was moving toward an all-out attack on the Ixian Empire.

At the same time, however, the Queen of the Imperium's Secret Service was doing its usual, very efficient investigating of the background of Ix.  As a precaution, she had sent a team to Ix to investigate the case.  As soon as they left, she demanded to know if anyone had any idea where the bomb might come from.

"Thufir Hawat," Leto said, speaking to a guard at his side, "I'll take this as a personal gift."

Hawat nodded and gave Leto a quick, stiff salute, then nodded to Rhombur and Kailea.

Leto passed through a lock and opened the outer door of the Imperial audience chamber.  He looked down the crowded hall, at the rows of seats and the general confusion.  The only security man in the room was the Mentat Piter de Vries, and he kept his gaze on the Grand Palais.  He didn't look suspicious.

"Welcome to Ix, sir," he said.  "We are not your usual customers."

"I have a positive problem with the Palace," the Mentat responded.  "I require a private audience with the Duke Leto Atreides at this moment."

Leto sighed and gave the Mentat a cold glance.  "I am aware of that, too.  We are not in the same category."

"I have been more than a little confused at this all along, m'Lord.  I thought we were merely discussing . . . business."

The Imperials' handsome, aquiline features were framed with a thin, cadaverous mustache that glinted in the light from a hole in the center of his mustache.  His dark eyes glinted like sunken gold.

"I have been an important member of the Landsraad Council," de Vries said, with a smirk, "and I was unaware of the formal relationship between our Houses.  The Duke is my superior on Arrakis, you know.  I am his political superior, but I am also his military adviser, and I carry the Imperium.  I'm . . . I was a member of the Landsraad Council and I was discreet, but when my work here with the Atreides began, I realized it was much more than a personal matter.  I was here to witness the best interests of the Atreides family, and I was embarrassed to see how much the Harkonnens spied on the others.  I had to assume that the Crown Prince was aware of the transactions."

"Are you familiar at all with the arrangements for poisons?"  Leto asked.

"I have a certain expertise in chemical warfare, m'Lord, which I can call to mind.  I know nothing about poisons, but I know of the most deadly ones."

"That is not the way to talk to the Duke," Leto said.

Hawat touched the sleeve of his stillsuit, his eyes flashing in the light.  "It is not the way to talk to the Duke, sir, because he is my superior in most things.  That is my duty."

"If I ask questions, do you know what to answer, or do you think me an immature child?"  Leto said.

"I think you're the right shade," the Mentat said, and he smiled.

"Do you want me to see the Baron?" Leto asked.

"I think not.  It is not a matter of protocol, sir, though."

Leto took a deep breath and decided to follow through on his plan.  "The Bene Gesserit want to see the Baron.  He is a powerful man, a man with many powers.  I want to see him.  He has nothing to fear from me."

"And if I should find yourself unable to join them?"

"Then I shall just have to ask for assistance."

"Do you mean that you are willing to face-guard yourself, while the Harkonnens are elsewhere?"

"I have no choice, m'Lord."

"Then I will take your word for it.  I cannot do it alone, but I can ask the Bene Gesserit to send guards."

"You

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The engine roar of an engine could be heard, but it was not a continuous roar. It pulsed to a rhythm that One-Eye saw as it climbed out of the ground. It was as if the life force that possessed it were pumping it up and down, up and down, in its own precise rhythm, though in the same way as the beating of a heart.
    "That is the rhythm of the heart," he said. "The beating of a heart is the beating of a heart. We are all breathing." 
    "Isn't that a little drastic?" 
    "If it's so serious."
    "It isn't. It is."
    "I have seen people's hearts in action." 
    "No one has." 
    "But they all have. You can't take it. You can only think about it."
    "What is the meaning of this?"
    "It's the way we feel. It's the rhythm we think of. It's the rhythm of our lives. We think of it as being like the rhythm of the heart. It's the rhythm of the heart, just the same." 
    "The hell with it," Rick said.
    "You have to give it up," she said. "You have to have it finally." 
    "The hell with it."
    "You've had enough of it. It is too late, now."
    "I don't have any more."
    "It's too late, then." She stood at the edge of the roof field, staring down at the crowd of people and the lights below. "It's too late for you," she said. "I'm afraid to come here any more. I'll never see you again."
    "That's enough," Rick said. "I'm leaving now."
    "You're going out to do a little shopping again?"
    "For a while."
    "I'll go with you." She shifted in her seat, the metal chair creaking beneath her. "I'll buy a book."
    "You have a mind of your own," Rick said. "You don't get into my mind."
    "I have a mind," she said. "I'll stay here." She looked up at him. "I know I'll be all right. They told me to come to you, that you might come along. If I'm not in any way, if I ever become weak or if I get sick or something, then you'll know why."
    "I want to know everything," Rick said.
    "I'll stay," she said. "I'll be safe here." She reached out, tugging at his hand. "You don't have to go. I'll stay with you."
    "Why?"
    "Because I don't know any other way."
    "It sounds like you're going to stay, too."
    "I am," she said. "I don't know any other way." She smiled at him. "I have this madness that seems so much more serious than it is. I keep expecting to die."
    "But you will," he said.
    "I will stay," she said.
    "What?"
    "I'll never look at you again," she said. "I'll never see you again. I'll keep on living here."
    "I'll die here."
    "That's the way it is," she said. "There's no other way."
    "But I love you."
    "Love is dead."
    "You said you could never love me."
    "You love everything I've ever done."
    "Yes." She nodded. "I love you."
    "And I love you."
    "You said I couldn't."
    "You said I could do it."
    "It's done."
    He stood, the chair tipping over, and he looked at her. She was dressed in her street clothes, sitting in a straight chair, a tablet of some kind on her lap. Her face was gray, without color or warmth, and her mouth was a faint rictus of grim ecstasy.
    "You have to go," he said.
    "It's the way I felt, the way I was thinking. It's the

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The birds, too, were too bright to look at. They glided by like flying flying houseflies, their wings beating rhythmically. The sun, too, shone down on the wood, and the white oak.

I took my time, watching the shadows move across the oak. Some were on my way to start, but others of the night watchmen were turning their heads, I knew, and I wondered how many. One or two, I saw, were carrying a flashlight.

My watch was not the only watch in the house. In the garden. I went down to get my umbrella. The little old lady who lived there took a chance and gave me a light to illuminate the trees. I stepped into the light and found it was nearly noon. The house was empty, as always. The old lady, who lived alone and worked late, had gone. I walked around her. It seemed strange to me that an old man would live alone, alone and to have friends with him. But I found no mention of a family. She had lived alone and worked late for two years, and she had made a home on two little old books and a cat. The rest of the house was as it had been. The big old books and the cat had gone. I was curious. I walked over and opened the door.

The old woman was sitting in a chair, reading. She looked up and saw me. She smiled. “That’s fine,” she said. “I’m fine,” I said. “Be careful,” I said. I couldn’t remember if she had told me she was alone or not.

“I’m not safe,” she said. “I have to get home.”

“Well, don’t worry.”

“It’s kind of a long walk,” she said, still looking at the book. “But we won’t be here long.”

“You’re sure?” I asked.

“I’ve been here since yesterday afternoon. I’ve been walking around everywheres, not knowing where I am. I’m beginning to feel . . . well, uh, unsteady.”

“That’s okay,” I said. “It’s fine,” she said. She closed the book and put it aside on the shelf. “We walked around a while. We don’t know for sure, but it seems like about two hours ago, there wasn’t any walk. The sky is darkening and the wind is getting stronger. It’s a bit chilly, I guess.”

“It’s a bit chilly,” I said.

“It is. But it’s a bit stronger than it gets to be. I’ve been walking around for a while now. I’ve gotten to where I think I can see some light. I guess I can see a bit of it. I’m still walking around, but I can see that light in the distance.”

“I can see a little light in the distance,” I said.

“You’ve been walking around in this rain.”

“I guess,” I said. “And anyway, I think I’ve got to be going. I have to get home,” I said. “But I think I can walk as far as I want. I have to get home, and I’m walking around and waiting for the lights to change, so I think that’s okay.”

“Good,” she said.

“So,” I asked, “do you think maybe we could have dinner sometime?”

“I don’t know. But we could talk for a while.”

“Well, maybe,” I said. “But I can’t eat right now.”

“Well, I can eat.”

“I’m fine,” I said.

“And I can’t take it,” I said. “I’ll go to the station tomorrow, and then I’ll walk somewhere. I can’t walk too much more tonight, I’d think.”

“That’s okay,” she said.

“But I’m still going,” I said.

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The town was submerged, hushed, and subdued.

“That’s a nice car you have here,” he said.

“Thanks,” she said.

The townspeople were a middle-aged man and a woman, neither of them looking like anyone she knew. They sat in the park, drinking beer, gazing up at the sky, and the fields on both sides of the road. The man was middle-aged, and had a white mustache and glasses. The woman was young and wore a plain white blouse. Both wore glasses, and the man was dressed in a white cotton business suit. A white linen bag was slung over his shoulder. The woman’s eyes were set wide and hard, like a piece of luggage. The man was short, with a plaid shirt and tie. Both men wore sunglasses, and the woman wore a white sweatshirt.

“I’m from here,” the man said. “I’m looking for a young woman who works in this town.”

“The right one,” she said.

“I thought so.”

“I’m from this town,” she said. “Do you have a name?”

“I have a name,” he said. “I called you a street punk.”

“A street punk,” she said. “A cool guy.”

He looked at her in surprise.

“You sure you don’t want a drink with me?”

“Why do you think I have a drink with you?”

“I’m not a street punk.”

She looked at him in surprise. “You sure?”

“Because I know somebody’s up here,” he said. “Somebody’s paying to see you.”

“You do?”

“I’m a spook,” he said. “A high school girl. And you can bet your bottom dollar’s worth I’ll never pass the security check.”

“So you’re from here?”

“Sure,” he said. “They got all these cameras up here, all over the place.”

“You have a wife?”

“I do,” he said. “There’s a wife.”

She looked at him in surprise.

“I was over at her place, looking for you. I had to ask her to let me in.”

“I didn’t notice,” she said. “I thought you were in someplace else.”

He looked at her a long time.

“Where are you from?”

“Tokyo,” he said.

“I’m in Yokohama.”

“It’s a long drive.”

“The mountains,” she said.

“The mountains?”

“The mountains I came from.”

“I’m a stupid old man,” he said. “I have no idea where I’m from.”

“The mountains,” she repeated, “the mountains?”

“That’s right,” he said. “I’m an old man.”

“I know,” she said. “The mountains.”

“Anyway,” he said, “I have a question for you.”

“Sure.”

He asked her to go sit on the bench next to him, and she did as she was told. Her body was completely immobile. He could see her eyes. He could almost hear her calling out to the birds, but there was nothing of that. He could see her hair, but he could not see that. Her face was completely still, and her expressionless gaze absorbed him in its own way. She was not a real person. He felt as though the spring had come and gone, the leaves on the tree in the park were shedding, and the light at the window was fading.

“I have a question for you,” she said. “And I want you to answer it right now, without wasting any time.”

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. The enormous concrete structure stretched away to the right as if submerged in a deep sea.

To the left of the cranes was a quicksand, or perhaps a lot of different-colored wood. It looked like a huge asphalt dray piled on top of a low-rise parking lot, a thicket of black weeds that looked more like weeds than concrete. The air above the ground was warm and moist and smelled of a variety of things: the scents of thousands of decaying fish, the odors of dozens of rats, the ashes of countless fires.

Behind the crescent of wood stood the office, and behind the office were the tall wooden buildings. The offices and offices of the town. Everything looked drab and windowless.

The old man’s leather coat had gone. He now wore a trench coat. It had been tossed aside to reveal the top of his brown wool hat. I studied him for a long time, then turned back to the front of the van. We stepped off onto the blacktop road. The road led off to the right into the woods, then returned to the van, the van moving at a brisk pace, its owner standing beside it. The road was solid stone. The branches of the tall pine trees overhead glistened in the light from the midday sun.

“I hope I can see to his wife,” I said to the old man.

“I have no wife,” he answered.

“But you have a wife.”

“The daughter of God.”

“I have no daughter,” I said. “I have only one son.”

“I have no sons,” the old man repeated to me.

We followed the road for a while. The afternoon sun shone down on the road, making its way through the trees like a soft, clear water. There was not a cloud in the sky, just a persistent plume of smoke that seemed to move through the air.

“Your wife is not well, is she?” the old man asked me.

“Not well,” I said. “But I know she is well. She cannot be separated from me. I cannot take her from you.”

“But you would never see her again.”

“No, you would never see her again.”

The old man laughed. He seemed to be in a great deal of pain at having said this.

“But you have no children,” he said, and smiled.

“No, I do not have children.”

“Are you a lonely man,” the old man asked me, “that you can’t have children?”

“No, I am not lonely,” I said. “I have this feeling to the last,” I said, “that I could have children, but that I am not, that there is no reason for me to have children.”

The old man let out a long, cold breath. “That is good,” he said. “I know you are not lonely. You have no need for loneliness.”

“But I have no need for loneliness,” I said. “I have found that I need no loneliness.”

The old man opened his mouth, but he seemed unable to go on. He took a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his mouth on his hand, and slowly looked at the road ahead.

“You are in trouble,” he said to me. “You have grown into the heart of a lonely old man.”

“I can’t help it,” I said. “I’ve lived too long.”

“Nor did I,” said the old man. “You are a lonely man. You have grown accustomed to live alone. You find it impossible to live for yourself.”

“No, that’s not it,” I said. “It’s the other way around. I’m never lonely,” I said. “I have people I know, people like you. They live for me. They are my friends.”

The old man gave a slight cough.

“I wonder,” he said, “if you would not like to live by yourself.”

“No, I don’t,” I said. “I don’t want to live by myself.”

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

“Did she ever get to see them?” Tengo asked Fuka-Eri.

Fuka-Eri did not reply to this. She had been deep in thought, trying to find exactly what she wanted to say. Finally, she said, “She’s not allowed to come here.”

“That’s good,” Tengo said. “That’s great.”

“But she’s going to stay here.”

“She will not stay here,” Tengo said. “She’s not going to go anywhere.”

“Why not?”

“You told her it’s not like there’s a door in the sky.”

Fuka-Eri gave a little shrug, as if she had been in a conversation with herself. Then she turned to Tengo and asked, “How about you?”

“I’ll stay here,” Tengo said. “I’ll stay here.”

“And I’m staying here,” she said.

“You can’t do that,” Tengo said. “There’s no way for you to do that.”

“I know,” she said.

“The Little People are watching over you. They’ve been watching over me for a long time.”

“But I can’t do anything.”

“You have to do something,” Tengo said. “It’s all I can do.”

“But you can’t do anything.”

“You can’t do anything.”

“I don’t care,” she said.

“No, you don’t have to do anything.”

“You can’t do anything.”

Tengo sighed. “I don’t care.”

“I know,” she said, “but I don’t want to do anything.”

“You don’t have to do anything,” Tengo repeated.

“I don’t know what you mean,” she said, as if confirming it.

“Because you can’t do anything.”

“I don’t have to do anything.”

“Because you don’t have to do anything.”

“Because I don’t have to do anything.”

“Because you don’t have to do anything?”

“Because I don’t have to do anything.”

“Because you’re not even there,” Tengo said, surprised to hear his voice. “You’re not there, and you’re not there. You’re in another world.”

“Is this world?”

“You bet it is. It’s the real world, the world we live in.”

“We’re not in a world that exists,” she said.

“Look,” Tengo said. “That’s all I can tell you. I can’t explain it, but I don’t want to explain it either. And I don’t want to explain it to you. I’m not a human being. I don’t have to explain things to you. You don’t have to listen to me. That’s what I think. But I can’t do anything I don’t have to do. You can’t stop me. Because if you do, I’ll never come back to you.”

“No, that’s not the problem,” she said.

“You’re not in a physical state right now,” Tengo said, echoing her words.

“No, not in a physical state.”

“That’s right.”

“Because you’re not there,” she said.

“You don’t have to go there,” Tengo said

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

As they entered the city, a band of Polish musicians marched along with drumsticks and brass instruments, tuning up the hum of Wagner's Siegfried's performance. The evening was cool and warm.

“The music is exquisite,” said Juana. “The voice is like music in the darkness.”

“No, it’s not just that. It’s warm and dry and very romantic.”

“That is because Wagner’s voice is so strong.”

“It’s a wonderful voice,” I said. “It’s like music in the darkness.”

“Wagner’s voice is like music in the darkness.”

“I think I know,” I said. “Just because I don’t know it doesn’t make it more musical.”

“Actually, it makes it more beautiful.”

“More beautiful.”

Juana nodded.

“It really sounds wonderful,” she said.

I was overwhelmed. “You know, Juana, I really like Wagner.”

Juana raised her eyebrows and smiled. “That’s what I call Romantic music.”

“But you don’t know that,” I said. “Because you’re a professional pianist.”

Juana nodded. “Because I like the way he sounds.”

“Because he’s dead.”

“You’re saying you like Wagner because he’s dead?”

She smiled and looked at me. “I like that in a certain way.”

“But you’re a professional pianist, right?”

“No, that’s not it. I just want to be loved. I like it to be loved.”

“You can’t be loved by someone who’s not a real pianist,” I said. “You can only be loved by someone who can be a real pianist. That’s the kind of person you have.”

Juana raised her eyebrows. “You’re right.”

“People who are not real pianists do not want to be liked.”

“People who are not real pianists don’t want to be loved,” she said, and smiled again.

“What you’re saying is—”

She put both hands on my shoulder and froze.

“What I’m saying is—don’t you want to know my secret?” she said.

“I do,” I said.

She started to cry. She squeezed my hand. Then she stopped.

“You don’t need to cry,” I said. “It’s not the time to tell anyone.”

She shook her head.

“It’s just that, when you think about it, you can’t really understand,” I said. “I can only cry if I understand.”

She shook her head again.

“I understand,” she said. “I understand what you mean. But I don’t want to be understood.”

“Why not?”

“Because I want to be different.”

She sighed. Then she smiled.

“I know,” she said. “I’m trying to tell you that.”





Juana’s Visit


We were in the kitchen of her apartment. It was a small square apartment in the city of an artificial town, with one small window and a roof that supported a thin curtain of winter sunlight. She was sitting on a sofa, her legs crossed on the foot of the sofa. She had on a cotton sweater, and her hair was tied back in a ponytail. The clouds were still lined with snow. Snow could be seen in the sky.

She glanced at me without expression. “I don’t know if I’ve told you this before or not. I’m sorry. It’s just a simple statement of fact. I can’t explain any better.”

She gave a slight bow of her head. “I don’t really mind explaining it,

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

It was a hot, humid evening. A half dozen hard core-lined buildings were down
there, along with a few temporary ones, stacked like bricks. The buildings
were mostly old wooden shacks that had once supported planes. The ground was
dusty with damp grass. The ratlike creatures of the rat hounds were
sprawled over on top of the structures, snuffling and twitching.

The sky was a pale gray as the sun set. The wind was cool and brisk.
The rising wind, unseen, was cool.

Two cars, one blue, one dark, stood in a line across the street,
surrounded by a crescent of small buildings. It looked like a large city.
The other car had gone. I had seen that car go before.

The ratty buildings to the east of me were riddled with windows and
substantial rubble. The back of one of the cars was smashed and smoking.
Several pieces of furniture lay scattered in the street as if it had been
the wreckage of a car.

I walked over to the rubble and looked down. It was raining now, and a
rain of small bits of cloth were scattered along the street, all of them
half-concealed. The upper windows of one of the huts were empty. I
approached the wreckage. The wind rose and billowed across the broken
buildings. Some of the glass was gone.

The ratty building stood, untouched, a half dozen steps away.

I stood uncertainly at the entrance, staring at the building. It had been
a large building, a real big building. I remembered the kind of building
that had been burned to the ground.

The entrance was locked.

The wooden staircase leading up to the door was gone.

The door to the second floor was a solid block of concrete, with a
pillar of iron on either side. The door to the third level was opened.

There was dust on the stone walls, and in the corners of the entrance
crawled, twisted and frayed boards of stone, moss, and rusted
broadside.

The door to the rear of the building was, as I had expected, ajar.
A man stood at the doorway, a dark-haired man wearing a coat of arms.

I stepped inside, and the man said, 'No. A woman.'

I said, 'I'm looking for a woman.'

'Yes,' he said. 'You are a man.'

'I have come to live here.'

'Ah,' he said. 'Yes, you do.'

'I'm sorry to bother you,' I said.

'No, no,' he said. 'Not at all. You are welcome to live here.'

'Thank you,' I said.

He said, 'You are welcome to live here.'

'Thank you.'

'I am a wanderer,' he said.

'Yes,' I said.

'I know you are,' he said.

'I have come to live here.'

'Yes,' I said.

'You will live here,' he said.

'Yes,' I said.

'I am a wanderer,' he said.

'Yes,' I said.

'You will live here,' he said.

'Yes,' I said.

'You are welcome to live here.'

'Yes,' I said.

'You will live here?' he asked.

'Yes,' I said.

'Do you know a man named Verna?'

'No,' I said.

'She is a whore,' he said.

'Do you know a man named Bertram?'

'No,' I said.

'He works in the oil factories,' he said.

'Yes,' I said.

'He is a tall man with dark hair?'

'Yes,' I said.

'He works the same as me?'

I nodded.

'He is not a man,' he said, 'and he is not a whore. He is a very
sensible man. He is very rich and very clever. He is very careful
about his money. He takes only a very small interest in a thing, but
he pays attention to his own interests and other people's interests,
even to the poorest of people.'

'But I lived in this apartment for six months,' I said. 'For
six months alone.'

'Yes,' he said, 'the rest of your life.'

'But then the earthquake struck,' I said.

'That

     "Now what?" Ragle asked, stopping dead for a moment.
     "A horse," Vic said, pointing to a black horse. "A big white horse."
     Ragle looked up at the sky. It looked like a big bowl. The sunset
had been a blue sky. Now it was a deep, subdued blue.
     "Horses," Vic said. "In the town."
     "But we can't ride," Ragle said. "Not horses."
     "We'll wait for the kids."
     "How long will it be light?"
     "A half hour."
     "In that dress?"
     "They're tired."
     "How long will they be?"
     "I don't know."
     "Do you think we should go on?" Vic said.
     "I don't know."
     "How long will it be light?"
     "They won't tell us that. Maybe a little later. A quarter of an hour
from now."
     "Any more gas?" Ragle asked.
     Vic said, "We can use some gasoline."
     "Let me off right now," Vic said.
     The two of them walked off, onto the road.
     "You can't drive," Ragle said.
     Vic said, "But we can ride."

     "They're sure as hell not riding," Vic said, staring at the empty
garden.
     "Yes, we're sure as hell not," Ragle said.
     "What?" he said.
     "They're sure as hell not," Vic said.
     "How do you know?"
     "Because I saw them doing it with a radio," Vic said.
     "What did they do with a radio?"
     "They talked into a radio," Vic said. "They talked into a big radio.
It went on and on and on. They talked into a big radio. And then they
talked into a radio. They talked into a radio. They talked into a radio.
They talked into a radio. And then they talked into a radio. They talked
into a radio. They talked into a radio. They talked into a radio. And
then they talked into a radio. They talked into a radio. But it wasn't
a radio. It was too big. The thing in the garden was too big. It
was too big. It had too much power."
     "You mean they could enter the garden and do all this stuff?"
     "It's a possibility," Vic said. "But it's not a chance. They
could enter anytime they want. Anyhow, nothing can stop them; they
won't have to leave. Anyhow, they're too far away. The one they
went to talk to me with was a dead man. A couple of days from the
time they got here. They talked into a radio. They talked into a
radio. There's nothing wrong with the radio. They talked into a
radio. They talked into a radio."
     "And they said," Ragle said, "that they're going to stay a while
here?"
     "I don't know," Vic said. "It's a possibility. They may stay another
day, or a week, or even longer. They just can't take it, now."
     "What do you think Vic meant?"
     "I don't know," Vic said. "I don't know. He just sat there and
thought."
     "What's the matter?"
     "Nothing. Nothing at all."
     "But you were talking into a radio. You were saying into a
radio."
     "That's what I was thinking. I thought I heard something."
     "You thought you heard something. Did you hear anything?"
     "No," Ragle said. "Not a damn thing."
     "You thought you heard something."
     "No."
     "You thought you heard something."
     "No," Ragle said.

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. A few cars moved by, and the sun glinted off the steel rails of a number of gargles as the cars drew closer. The sun also reflected off the glossy puddles of a number of small buildings which stretched away on both sides.

“What kind of place is this?” Aomame asked.

“It’s a private hospital,” Ayumi said. “The hospital where the tamer and the hunter were shot. The night they were shot, they were taken by hospital staff to a private hospital in Akasaka. This is the place.”

“Do they have pictures of Tengo in the hospital?”

“Pictures of Tengo?” Ayumi asked in surprise. “How could they possibly have pictures of him?”

“They have a lot of pictures of each other.”

“It’s like a zoo,” Ayumi said. “No one can get near the animals.”

“The entrance’s locked,” Ayumi said.

“That’s the one problem.”

“It’s not locked,” Ayumi said. “It can be opened. They have photographs of Tengo in the hospital, and the tamer killed him. But Tengo’s body is in the hospital. That’s why the hospital has photos of Tengo, and the tamer’s still there.”

“How did they get these pictures?”

“It’s complicated. The process is probably some kind of medical fluid,” Ayumi said. “A piece of tissue such as tissue, mixed with a few other substances, and then dried, and then transferred to a special plastic capsule. I can’t say. It looks like something they might use for surgery. But how do they do it?”

“I don’t know. It has to be done with great care. They’re not just letting someone out in the night, killing the people they ‘re watching,’ and transferring them to the hospital. They have cameras and tape machines, and a big computer. And they have a black-and-white image-track, so even if they turn the camera off, it can tell what they’ve been doing.”

“So if the photos prove that Tengo’s dead, the death of one of the people is certain to cause that person to death.”

“Exactly,” Ayumi said. “It could be that way. It’s a probability that their cameras haven’t been set on. There have been two rumors, but neither of them has been confirmed.”

“But if the people in the hospital are some sort of secret organization,” Aomame said, “if they have a kind of organization, even if they have a big, well-organized organization, and it’s only a few people, they’ll never be able to get rid of the photos.”

“But who can tell? Who can say for sure?”

“I don’t know,” Ayumi said. “I can’t be sure. But I don’t think that’s the case.”

Aomame was at the kitchen table, making a cup of coffee, when Ayumi left the kitchen. She stood there, hands on hips, and looked straight at Aomame, without even smiling. “I think I can guess what she’s doing,” she said quietly.

“I really don’t know.”

“I know,” Ayumi said. “Look at me. She’s found a perfect way to kill herself. And I’m not giving her a hint. But I think she’s been creeping around somewhere, very stealthily, for a while now, and we have to get to the bottom of it.”

“You think she’s been hiding around here for a while, but she wasn’t doing that for very long.”

“It’s possible. But she’s not doing anything. She’s not planning to do anything. She’s just sitting here, thinking. The sun’s up, and the streets are deserted, but even so, she doesn’t move. She doesn’t even turn around.

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.  It was a slow-setting sunset, and the sun glinted off the thick wet grass of the sand.  The scene was unreal; it had no reality.  A long-neglected dream walked around the fire and then disappeared.  In another instant the two suns were alone.

"A little noise, is it?"  Maya whispered.

"You can hear it," Frank said.

"You can't hear it?"

"No."

"Do you know what it is?" she asked.

"It is the sound of the wind," he said.  "Come on."  He slid out of the shadow of the house and began to climb the black stairway.  The black sand rippled under his feet.  As he reached the top of the stairway he saw a tiny speck, a brown speck, on the sand.  It grew larger, then larger, grew into a furred membrane, and finally blossomed into a black-and-white shadow.  A hole, a shallow depression in the sand, opened up a meter or two wider.  The speck glistened for a second, and then it lay beside the doorway, a black rectangle in the sand, its edges glowing in the starlight.  
He stood there for a long time, staring at the shadow, listening to the beating of his heart.  A red glow came on the horizon; he waited for it to go away, for he wanted to go away.  But it never did.  He stared at the shadow again.  The thing was gone.  Silence gripped him.
Then, the glow out of the speck, the shadow of the hole, grew bigger.  The shadow of the hole grew larger.  Then he saw it, a tiny speck of silver in the sand.  It was a face.  He knew what it was.  It was his friend.  
But how could he be sure?
He looked over the edge, and looked down.  The face was gone, blown away by the rushing air.  He could see the long, narrow eyes, the long hair.  There was no sign of a nose, only a curious curve of the lips.  
He walked back down the stairway, and stood staring at the shadow on the sand, staring at the shadow's edge.  He felt a new exhilaration, the sense of power he had been able to withhold from the others, that he was in command.  The strange power of power.  
The face smiled at him.
He stood, still holding his gun, still staring at the shadow, at the harsh curve of the face.  It smiled back, relaxed, became content.  The smile vanished.  
He stood again.  The shadow moved closer, coming up behind him.  
"A stupid trick," Frank said.  "You shouldn't have shot at the face!"
The man stood facing him.  "It's not a stupid trick."
Frank turned to his friend.  "How do you know?"
"I know, I saw it once.  I was there, when the others were shooting at the face."
"You're not crazy!" Frank cried.  "You're the one who shot at the face!"
The man did not respond.  He turned and looked at Frank's face, eyes filled with concern.  "You can't mean that!" he said.
Frank's tone was indignant.  "That's what I said, that's what I said!  You can't say that!"
"It's the truth."
"Are you insane?  Do you think I'm an insane man?  Do you think I'm an insane man?"
"You are," Frank said.
"It's not a trick!"  He turned to face Frank.  "Look at your hands!"
"I'll show them to you," Frank said.
"What are you going to do with them?"
"What do you mean?"
"We'll be going back to your house.  You can let us in if you want to, but I'll stay with the body."
"That's not what I mean!"  
Frank shrugged.  "I mean, what do you think you're going to do with them?"
"I'm going to leave them there, in the sand.  I'll take off one at a time, and make sure they don't go back to the house."
Frank thought for a moment.  "You're right.  It's useless anyway, you know that.  You have no power over the dead."
"What do you mean?  I have my power over the dead."
"The dead is dead.  I'll do what

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.

Lidia, Rosa and Josefina stepped out of the truck, sat down and hugged
themselves and laughed.

"You're the only men I've seen," Lidia said. "The other boys
have been nice to us."

"We should have been glad to see them," Rosa said, smiling. "We
could have been so nice to them. I guess you were right. But they're
not here, they're gone."

"Don't they want to come back?" Lidia asked.

"They want to go," Rosa said in a matter-of-fact way.

"Why?" Lidia asked.

"Because they have to," Lidia said.

"Because they have to be very clever," Rosa said. "And don't you
see, Lidia, that they are not going to be able to, by any chance, to get
here at night? They'll have to come back at dawn."

"They're not going to come back at dawn," Lidia said. "Not if they
come to get us. And they're not going to get us because we are not
here."

"That's true," Rosa said.

"What are they going to do with us?" Lidia asked.

"Well, they're going to keep us, for now. They will be sitting on
top of the truck and they will see that we are alive, and they will
tell us to get out."

"You think they will do that?" Lidia asked.

"Don't know. I don't know what to do," Rosa said. "They're not
counting on me to keep them."

Lidia was more angry than she had shown before. She seemed to be
having trouble deciding whether to cry or to laugh.

"You are going to tell on us, aren't you?" Lidia demanded.

"What are you complaining about? We're going to stay and
watch. They will come back. They will decide who they are and
what they're going to do."

"What are you going to do?"

"We are going to stay," Rosa said. "But we are going to go
back to Lidia and Josefina. We have to keep them."

"And we are going to stay," Rosa added.

"Yes, yes," Lidia said. "We are going to stay. But I'm not
going to stay. I don't care anymore. All the time I have been
here. All the time we were here. They won't ever bring me back
to them."

Rosa said nothing. She was crying. She seemed to be crying
for joy.

Lidia stood up from the bench and walked to the stove and
turned on the stove. She sat down in the chair again and hugged
herself and laughed. She laughed and cried at the same time.

"We are going to stay," she said. "You can't do anything to
change that."

"I don't know what you're talking about," Lidia said. "I'm not
going to stay. I don't want to be like you. I don't want to be like
you. I'm not going to be like you. I'm going to go away. I am going
to leave you. Now."

"What are you going to do?" Lidia demanded.

"You, too," Rosa said.

Rosa took her hand and pressed it to her cheek. She looked
at Lidia.

"You, too," Lidia said.

"And we, don't you?" Rosa said.

"Yes," Lidia said. "We are going to stay."

Rosa took her hand and pressed it to her cheek again. She did
not know what she was doing. Lidia stood up and was facing the
others. "You, too," she said. "You are going to stay."

"No, we are going to stay," Rosa said.

"We are going to stay," Lidia said.

"Then why is everyone crying?" Rosa asked.

"I don't know," Lidia said. "I don't know why."

"You're crying because you're afraid," Rosa said.

"Yes, that's right," Lidia said. "We are afraid."

"But you're not going to stay," Rosa said. "You're going
to leave. You are going to leave your house."

"No," Lidia said. "We are going to stay. We are going to stay
until the whole thing

        "Good evening, Rimbol," said Ken.
        "Good evening, Ken," the young man replied, smiling
wistfully back.
        "I was just wondering if you'd mind taking a trip with me."
        "What sort of a trip?"
        "Well, you'd be the first to know. I'm sure there are other
travelers in town, besides the neighbors."
        "Oh, Ken," cried Junie, her eyes popping. "What does that mean? Where
will we go?"
        "I think I can explain it to you better," he said, smiling
encouragingly at her.
        "But I don't understand," she protested. "I don't belong here,
and you don't. I mean, I'm not property, I'm just ... I mean, I'm not
myself. How can you talk about me that way?"
        "Well, I don't expect you to be either," he said, with a grin.
        "I don't want to be," she said, looking up into his face again.
        "I thought you didn't know," he said, with a shrug.
        "I mean, I don't know where I'm from," she exclaimed.
        "Neither do I," he said. "But you can't either and I'd be
sorry to hear it."
        "Oh, Ken, I don't know either," she exclaimed, her eyes
wild and full of tears.
        "You're not your own child anymore, are you?" he asked,
admonishingly.
        "No, I'm not," she murmured.
        "You're not," he said, sounding more and more
underwhelmed. "You're not, at least, your rightful self."
        "No, I'm not," she echoed, shaking her head.
        "I'll tell you another time," he said. "One of these days you
won't make a day of this to live."
        "Oh, Ken," she cried, her voice sobbing more than once.
"How can I help you?" Her arms pulled at his shirt.
        "Take it easy," he said, stroking her arm gently.
        "No, please, I can't go any more," she said. "I can't live
with you. It's not fair. I don't belong here."
        "Why?"
        "Because I'm not mine any more. I'm your wife."
        He lifted his wife by the shoulders and kissed her.
        "I love you," she murmured.
        "Yes, darling," he said, and stroked her cheek.
        "You're not so bad, are you?" she asked.
        "No, I'm not," he said. "I'm just a man. No one would ever
understand me. Not anyone. Not even my brother."
        "My brother," she said. "He was going to be everything to you.
He was going to be all the things you were not. I wanted him so bad."
        "And he wasn't going to be everything to you," he said. "He
was going to be everything to you because you're such a bad
lover, the way you are."
        "You didn't love him?" she asked, shocked.
        "I loved him a lot."
        "But you loved him."
        "Yes, I did."
        "But he was gone."
        "He was going to be something. He was going to be
something. He didn't want to be anything. He

-------------

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes. In another part of the city a man's feet still lay uncovered in a pile of rubble. People were running, screaming. He saw a woman's face in the crowd.

“My name’s Tsubasa,” she said. “I’m a few years older than you.” She stepped out of the crowd, her face expressionless, her bangs still on. “I do have a few questions.”

“A few questions?”

“Just a few.”

“Like, have you had dinner?”

“No, we have not.”

“I’ve been told you ate fish in a restaurant in Akihabara.”

“Yes, that’s correct,” Tsubasa said. “But it’s not as if I were eating alone. We have been eating together for four months now, and I’ve gotten better at it.”

“Well, I guess you did.”

“I was able to get more than anything else.”

“I see,” the chauffeur said. “Well, thanks to you, Tsubasa.” He shook his head.

Tsubasa’s face brightened. “Thank you,” she said, and walked over to the car. She got in, closed the door, and turned on the ignition.

“Where are we going?” Tsubasa asked.

“The zoo.”

“I’ll drive you there,” Tsubasa said, lowering her voice.

“You don’t have a car?”

“This one.”

Tsubasa turned right, then left, and stopped at a red light. “I have no idea where we are going.”

“Neither do I.”

Tsubasa turned left again, and walked through the red light at the intersection of the Yamagishi Bridge. A zoo is a beautiful, quiet place, she thought. People are very calm. And then she saw a man walking along the road, a man in a yellow slip shirt, walking very slowly. I’m screwed, she thought. That’s how I get wasted. People don’t walk around in their sleep, but look at the eyes of a person like me, she thought. People’s eyes are always closed.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “but there’s something I have to see to thank you for.”

The man was wearing a yellow slip shirt. His hair was short, his face thin. He looked like a high school student. His eyes were deep-set, and his face was expressionless. It looked like someone looking at a painting on the wall. When he was walking, his breath fluttered, and he seemed to be staring at something.

“This way, please,” Tsubasa said. “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”

“Nothing to worry about,” the man said. “Nothing at all.”

Tsubasa had to ask him a question.

“So,” the man said, taking his eyes off Tsubasa, “do you have any idea what I’m doing in this zoo?”

“Not a thing,” Tsubasa said.

“And you’re not planning to go in after me?”

“That I am not.”

The man’s eyes were shining. “It’s been a long time since I’ve spoken to a woman.”

“I’m sorry,” Tsubasa said. “I’m not sure what to say.”

The man’s eyes were glittering. “You’re right. Really.”

“It’s just that I feel like I’ve got to go see her.”

The man smiled. “Right. That’s why I’m going to buy a ticket.”

“A ticket to where?”

“That’s the good thing to do.”

“It’s a nice thing to do,” Tsubasa said. She was sound asleep.

The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.
"Look," said the man. "It is the coast."
They looked. The boats were there. Two of the craft were there. And, in the other boat, the other man's.
"It is the coast," he said, and stepped over the rail.
The two boats were there. The one had a flag atop it, but it was a much smaller one.
The other one was there.
"The other boat," said the man, "is a fief of the Coast."
"A fief!" murmured the man.
"Yes," said the other man. "The Coast."
"I don't know," said the man. "I have never seen it before. It is a long way off. Much farther. It is a great distance. But it is a great distance."
The man looked at him. "How do you know it is the Coast?"
"I was on the other boat. It came to me."
"How did it come here?"
"I was on the other boat. It came to me."
The other man looked at him. "How can you tell it from the other boat?"
"Because," said the man, "I know where it is."
"You know where it is now?"
"Yes. I am the Coast. I have come to you. It is the coast."
"It is the Coast?" asked the other man. "You can't be sure of that?"
"No," said the man, "I know where it is."
"But you are the Coast?" asked the other man.
"Yes. I am the Coast."
"Then we are the Coast," said the other man.
"Yes," said the other man.
"It is a long way," said the other man.
"Yes," said the other man. "Very long. There is no end to it."
"We will come to the coast," said the other man.
"Come with me," said the other man.
"You will not kill us?" asked the other man.
"I will not kill you," said the other man.
"Then you will have another taste of the pain of the Coast," said the other man.
"Yes, come with me," said the other man.
"You will do nothing to us," said the other man. "You will do nothing to us."
"Come with me," said the other man.
"Come with me," said the other man.
"Yes, come with me," said the other man.
"You will have nothing to do with us," said the other man. "We are strangers here."
"You are welcome," said the other man. "We are strangers."
"There is no reason to kill us," said the other man.
"There is reason to kill us," said the other man.
"There is reason to kill us," said the other man.
"There is reason to kill us," said the other man.
"Come along with me," said the other man.
"You are the Coast," said the other man. "You are the shore."
"There is no Coast," said the other man.
"There is no Coast," said the other man.
"There is a land called the Coast," said the other man. "A land called the Coast. We are here."
"You are a stranger here," said the other man. "A stranger of the Coast. We are the Coast."
"You are a strange man," said the other man. "A strange man. You are the Coast. You are the land. You are the sea and the land. You are the mountains and the mountains. You are the green of the land and the green of the mountains. You are a land of shadow and color and beauty and beauty. You are a land of enchantment. You are a land of enchantment. You are a land of enchantment. But your land is not enchanted. Your land is here. You are here, and you are here. You have come to us for the sake of your land. Your dream is here. It is here for you. You are here for us. We are here for you. And now you are leaving us, and you are not coming. You are not coming, and you are not going to leave us. You are not going to leave us."
He stepped back from the man and looked at him, incredulous, a man so small and so much smaller than himself, with the same tinge of something at once so queer and strange and mysterious and revolting.
"You are a stranger in this world," he said. "You are the Coast and the Mountains. You are a stranger in the world of the dream. You are not a man.
