The result of all this was that the lifeforms that were left on the infested earth - - hybrids, reptilian apes, mutated whales, and old biological humanoids - - were not only despised by the biological humans, but also by the infested.

In the face of this history, the unified minds of the infestation knew that they had been betrayed. They believed that the biological groups were simply lucky to survive when faced with the danger of the infestation. The living groups had chosen to have no part in the infestation, they could not imagine that they would ever leave. The infestation, on the other hand, had gone through every bit of their DNA: leaving them incapable of living a normal life. 

So they decided that the most appropriate decision was to transform the united biological species back to their own form.

The lifeforms of earth would often help them to act. For example, they would grant succor to several ordinary human beings who had been suffering from debilitating situations. After receiving the instructions of the living from their mission, the hybrid essence once again became a biological human, like all the other previous organisms. Unfortunately, they were no longer interested in protecting the living, and while they could in some way be regarded as 'good guys', their approach towards the infestation made it impossible for them to always trust them.

The blood of the race of mankind was the only vessel of their consciousness and they were quite often influenced by the inspiration of the humans. However, in many instances, the humans had made a mistake by using the living beings. For instance, the humans believed that they could repair the infestation, but the infestation would simply never cooperate for this. In this case, the Earth-born were not in a position to execute their duties for the final goal of the spiritual expedition. 

In this way, the organized groups decided to bypass the concern of the infestation by releasing the instructions to their own sentience to keep all living in danger. The military forces were actually pushed to the brink of declaring war on the infestation and the military structures of the earth were prepared for any eventuality.

One detail that caused quite a problem to the infestation was the fact that people such as Arnold Genestani were still in place who knew how to receive and decode the instructions that the lifeforms broadcast. It was once again decided that they had to be silenced in some fashion. The initial plan was to allow them to return to their home planet in some manner or other. Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld. The recent genocide committed by the forces of the infestation, from that day onward, went against everything Genestani stood for.

Genestani eventually managed to go to earth under the command of Sauron, using an Army of Artificial Infantry and an army of military personnel. The parts of the army was integrated into Sauron's intelligence center, with a remote link to the base from which he was supervised. Initially, the troops of the infestation were placed inside the ruins of the city. The first group of they first bastion that were gathered were a group of cyborg soldiers. While they worked around the clock to recover as much material as possible to construct a body for themselves, the main focus was on the construction of the new army. 

Most of the people on earth were completely unaware of the reality of the infestation. The greater part of them were divided into a special division of the military called the 'Soldiers of Erris'. However, many people of the united groups knew of the identity of their infestation-guards, although the divisions had still not been fused. Moreover, most of the members of the military bases continued to call them as 'soldiers of Erris'. A few units such as the Vihval military base remained unaware of the danger the infestation could pose to their existence. The news of the invasion spread quickly through the mass media, and with them the death toll on earth increased.

Colonel Branden, a former German armyman who was no longer interested in the lives of humans, moved his troops to one of the many bases of Sauron and launched a lightning attack on the land of

The blood of the race of mankind was the only vessel of their consciousness and they were quite often influenced by the inspiration of the humans.

For instance, the humans believed that they could repair the infestation, but the infestation would simply never cooperate for this. In this case, the Earth-born were not in a position to execute their duties for the final goal of the spiritual expedition. 

In this way, the organized groups decided to bypass the concern of the infestation by releasing the instructions to their own sentience to keep all living in danger. The military forces were actually pushed to the brink of declaring war on the infestation and the military structures of the earth were prepared for any eventuality.

One detail that caused quite a problem to the infestation was the fact that people such as Arnold Genestani were still in place who knew how to receive and decode the instructions that the lifeforms broadcast. It was once again decided that they had to be silenced in some fashion. The initial plan was to allow them to return to their home planet in some manner or other. Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld. 

The only reaction that the infested were able to create for the alien entity, once they had taken root and developed a complete form, was the mysterious disappearance of all civilization on earth. In this way, the aliens who became the infestation obtained free reign on all the solar systems within the cosmos. They even passed through some of the planets that were entirely covered with biological life forms. According to them, the humans were never conscious or sapient in the first place, and they were destined for extermination. Even more important is the fact that the scientists of earth had a lot to do with the discovery of such aliens. 

This was not only a fascinating incident, it was also a painful lesson. Thus, all knowledge about what was going on on earth was suppressed and classified by the scientists. This was the first time the humans who were informed of their impending destruction also kept the secret, even though they had the opportunity to do so. While the scientists secretly worried over the fact that the a powerful consciousness should not suffer annihilation, they all wanted to hide the secrets of this 'precious life form'. 

After using humans as a tool for their mission, the infestation now had a completely different world to govern than the humans. They gave several orders to their previous leaders and promised that they would never allow the presence of 'their kind' again. In the end, they also learned from the situation that the technology of the humans was very strong, as the core technology that they developed already gave the infestation a very powerful arsenal.

The last option was the one that they were most willing to make use of. In this scenario

Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld. With the release of information, the infested became aware that it was not so easy to change back, and the ideological proof that was once used against them caused them a crisis of faith.

The infestation began to feel that something was 'not quite right'. Sooner or later, the infestation was going to develop a certain degree of doubts concerning itself. There were two visions which shaped the infested state of mind. The first was the traditional vision that an infestation would be a huge army of planets, alien lifeforms, and microscopic terrorists that would suddenly invade the earth, attacking it from every side. In fact, the infestation had been preparing this event all the time. The other vision that the infested developed regarding the infestation was one of the most disturbing and heretical: There would be a deliberate and unprecedented war between the races of mankind that would completely destroy both the infestation and the human race. Although this was the most clear-cut goal, this future was offered to the infested solely because of the injustice it offered to human values. 

Unfortunately, the infestation was aware of both visions, and although they believed that the conditions for them to show the latter vision were favorable, they chose to never fully build it up in their minds. They knew that the evil was coming and hoped that this time it would not arrive on the earth too early. 

As a result, infested humanity was faced with almost constant battles that were never ending. In this context, even the scientific breakthroughs that the united minds could create would fail to achieve their goals, and much of the work that had been done was doomed

It was once again decided that they had to be silenced in some fashion. The initial plan was to allow them to return to their home planet in some manner or other. Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld. However, it failed in its mission to annihilate Arnold Genestani, who was then removed from the infestation on board a military vessel sent to the infested earth. This cause the total disappearance of the hybrid essence for more than 10,000 years.

The real result of this war was that the infestation was vanquished, and all information that could have been of use to it were taken away from it. The hybrids and extraterrestrial element were dealt with, and without their return, the infested earth could never return to the summit it had been, instead falling back to the point at which it had already fallen.

Unfortunately, despite the deaths of several members of the military forces of the infested earth, the infestation continued to grow at a breakneck pace. Any new information about its history caused the infestation to increase in numbers. Eventually, to control this continual expansion of the infestation, it was decided to land an invasion ship on the surface of earth. After learning of the planet's speed of rotation and speed of acceleration, the Earth-born planned to use their reinforcement. They captured numerous ships and shifted some of them back to their home planet. However, the invasion ship was shot down by the infestation. Due to a disastrous mission, the space-borne lifeforms of earth were exiled to the infested earth and their genetic memory could never be erased. For more than 10,000 years, the only remnants of the infested life of earth were the breath patterns of the indigenous biologicals. The other aliens that had made their home on the infested earth were now free to roam the surface. Their breath patterns could be

The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld. He actually arrived in the infested earth on a cryopod, which allowed the hybrid essence to return to the planet without fighting. The lifeforms remained silent throughout this process and appeared docile. The lesson was that any attempt to crush the infestation must be dealt with with deadly force.

The First Battle of the planets: Planets Infested by the Biological Humans (88 CE)

The new leaders of the biosphere were an alternate form of extraterrestrial. These beings could only be referred to as the cybernetic species. They were at least as old as the alien lifeforms, if not older. The cybernetic species, who had to follow the orders of the existing self-sufficient lifeforms of Earth, based on their own lives, had little interest in the infestation. However, the infestation had allowed them to manage some information - - some information that they wished to keep as it improved their image.

One of their leaders, an aged Marine, knew of the possibility that one day there might be a second victory against the biological humans and he was very eager to return to his planet. This landing plan was not carried out. Another event occurred before their departure which allowed them to better grasp the situation on their home planet. The cryopods used to land these heavily armed landers were kidnapped by the biosphere, and the cryo-infested marines did not return home. Instead, they were captured by the genetic manipulation beings. Instead of teaching them how to operate cryopods, they instead sent them to operate certain facilities on the planet for the cybernetic aliens. The attempted treatment of the marines, who had been

The result of all this was that the lifeforms that were left on the infested earth - - hybrids, reptilian apes, mutated whales, and old biological humanoids - - were not only despised by the biological humans, but also by the infested.

The blood of the race of mankind was the only vessel of their consciousness and they were quite often influenced by the inspiration of the humans. However, in many instances, the humans had made a mistake by using the living beings. For instance, the humans believed that they could repair the infestation, but the infestation would simply never cooperate for this. In this case, the Earth-born were not in a position to execute their duties for the final goal of the spiritual expedition. 

In this way, the organized groups decided to bypass the concern of the infestation by releasing the instructions to their own sentience to keep all living in danger. The military forces were actually pushed to the brink of declaring war on the infestation and the military structures of the earth were prepared for any eventuality.

One detail that caused quite a problem to the infestation was the fact that people such as Arnold Genestani were still in place who knew how to receive and decode the instructions that the lifeforms broadcast. It was once again decided that they had to be silenced in some fashion. The initial plan was to allow them to return to their home planet in some manner or other. Unfortunately, once again, the defense of the infested earth was offered to Genestani, who readily agreed. The results of the information such as the instructions sent to Arnold Genestani prevented the hybrid essence from returning to its homeworld.

Finally, the decision of the participants in the expedition was made to surround the infested earth with a long line of antimatter generation machines. The antimatter generation machine would then act as a deterrent against other ships that would try to venture beyond the 'safe zone'. The result of this decision was the arrival of a delegation of very powerful alien races from the Infestation. These in no way believed in the existence of the allied lifeforms of earth, and most of them were already quite hostile to earth.

The relative cooperation of the people of earth, and the fact that they had by now begun to cooperate with the infestation, led to the first direct confrontation between the two alien races. The hybrids had predicted that it would happen and had prepared as many anti-ship weapons as they could muster. Instead, the arrival of the visitors had astonished them and it had made them fully prepared for anything.

The effectiveness of the antimatter generation machines for defense proved to be in fact an illusion. Instead, the infestation had used the antimatter generation machines to bombard the entire infested earth with radioactive pellets. All the lifeforms of earth, including the hybrid essence, had instantly found themselves annihilated in the earth's atmosphere.

The head of the allied group of lifeforms, the pterodactyl-like giant Tyrannosaurus rex, decided that it was better to end the battle by shifting the internal structure of the Earth itself, smashing it into pieces. In order to do this, he had the dormant lifeform creature Artoo Detoo be inserted into the Earth. As the antimatter generation machines still were operational, they did
